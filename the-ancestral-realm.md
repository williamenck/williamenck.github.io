I was launched into heaven by my new family and then fell back to earth only to be embraced again by so many loving arms that once again launch me into heaven.

An uncle familiar with the mysticism of his Mexica ancestors told me that this wedding tradition is not only to launch one upward into a new, spiritual relationship of marriage and family life but also takes one "down" into the realm of the ancestors, into the past, and in to death and rebirth.

I suppose that mystics all around the planet have similar visions once their spirituality is liberated from the prejudices of social and personal dogmas and manipulations. With sincerity and originality one begins to see pure spirit clearly without desires and distortions. One sees the nature of life as it essentially is but also sees immortality in a realm beyond biological life.

It is possible perceive the spiritual realms as a band of energy that radiates all around the surface of the planet, from the deep roots of trees deep in the earth, high into their leaves in the sky, and everywhere in between where all the myriad forms of life force manifests. This is the earth`s aura. Completely liberated beings entirely transcend this planet and these energetic realms as they have no other desire than to be at one with the Consciousness of the Macrocosm. Those who still have desires for and debts with the planet exist within this band of subtle life force looking for a new physical body and an opportunity to incarnate again so as to continue resolving the mysteries of existence. We may not see these ancestral forces but they long to connect with us agian, to continue find their way onward and to share what they have learned with us.

To see and understand this dynamic reveals the secret of our collective past; all of our desires and hopes as well as our errors, suffering, and frustrations. The I-Ching tells us that one who clearly understands the relationship of the ancestors with actual human life could rule this planet from the palm of one`s hand. Each one of us is tossed into this life with little understanding of where we have come from and where we are going. The wisdom of spiritual traditions attempts to provide not just the desire and vision for a bright future but also an understanding of the ancestral influences that also impel us forward.

I considered him their spiritual and social leader, their wisest. He wanted to join us in the revolution and said that our work was exemplary. I knew he had suffered greatly remaining within the old, corrupt order. He admired us for being moral rebels and going against the grain of our own tradition and withstanding the attacks against us for this. We are not monastics nor formal meditation teachers yet people around the world think that we are doing the work of Ananda Marga when in fact we are entirely independent. I told him that I was commissioned by some of the older, direct disciples of Anandamurti to help continue the work of Ananda Marga after the organization had failed. I told him about our meeting with Ramananda so many years ago and how Ramananda spoke well of us just before his death and said we were doing the work that Anandamurti intended. I met with some leaders of Ananda Marga  after the Purulia Arms Drop in 1995. They knew Ananda Marga was infiltrated and was no longer really Ananda Marga. Some factions of A.M. had sold out to the Indian government, others to the communists in West Bengal, while others had sold out to Big Brother to help frame Ananda Marga as a terrorist organization. Due to this an entirely different approach must be taken. Anandamurti had foretold this years ago and said that the social organization of Ananda Marga would be annihilated but the ideas would later continue under new forms. Ramananda, although still holding a very high organizational rank in Ananda Marga, inspired us in this revolutionary direction.<br><br>After hearing this history the noble monk visiting us slammed his fist on my table, alighted upright and shouted “Let us tell them all to go to hell and start over with just Yama and Niyama and Kiirtan!”(the basic practices of meditation and ethics) I was so happy because we needed some orange in this revolution, monastics who can work outside the organization, yet still follow the essential discipline of Ananda Marga monasticism.<br><br>I thought we had some hope. However, he went back to his tribe in Ranchi that is controlled by gangsters and and nun beaters and told me we needed to make deals with them. This effectively put an end to any possibilities of working with him or any other Ananda Marga monasics.<br><br>Ramananda died recently. He left an autobiography about his life as personal secretary to Anandamurti. I first met him in 1995, just before the Purulia Arms Drop. He came out of his room to speak to a few of us who were visiting from Europe and the U.S. His eyes were a little sleepy. If it weren’t for his overall blissful composure, he almost appeared intoxicated. It was so obvious this man was really god-intoxicated and had just been truly enjoying a trip into deep meditation. And now he has to come out of it and talk to us. How could a mundane person understand such a state of mind other than referring to some sort of drug or alcohol induced state? Only his eyes were sleepy-looking, but his mind was so awake and sensible. His presence could certainly make one chill out much deeper than with wine or weed.<br><br>My friends had noticed something in me of late; that after deep and long meditation along the river, it looked like I was stoned. The joke with them was that I wasn’t really meditating, but secretly smoking something, that I was truly an incorrigible Austinite. I didn’t mind because I was really much lighter and healthier than I ever had been in my entire life and without pharmaceuticals, recreational drugs, alcohol, or meat.<br><br>I really liked him from the first moment he entered the room. I got a little of that eternal floating feeling that I would later experience even more strongly when I would meet Chandranath and his wife, Ram Parit Devii. I learned to distinguish between the politician and the saintly monastics by the vibration they left upon me. Sometimes that subtle vibration would last for days and would make one wonder, “where do they get this energy from? how can they invoke this bliss in others?” I saw that Ramananda had probably been enjoying for decades of meditation what I had only recently discovered after my initiation into tantric meditation a few years earlier.<br><br>When I saw Ramananda again it was several years later. I was already way far out on the fringes of A.M. I knew who was true but could see how so many people were falling into scandals and all sorts of non-sense. My protests were never public in those days and I only spoke about these issues with my friends.<br><br>I once again met Ramandanda in Mexico in 2002. He was surrounded by clowns and posers; monks puffed up with the vanity of being the ones chosen to implement “the mission of Baba.” It was all mostly ambitious self-delusion, the discourse of these spin-doctors. I had very little respect for the orange cloth by that time, but I felt very different near Ramananda. I remembered our first encounter and realized that this monk really belongs to an altogether different category than the others.<br><br>I meditated near him and some other monks. There was a dense vibration with the other monks. They were all mostly depressed, angry, and suffering from a lack of confidence in themselves and their organization after the arms drop and the A.M. civil war that ensued. There was also a recent scandal about how the monks were editing philosophical and social texts of Anandamurti. Not even a decade had passed and they had already started the adulterations that would give more power to the monastics instead of lay members of A.M. A few months later there would be a great and violent confrontation in India between the \"Hindi\" and \"Bengali\" factions of A.M. where they would crush each other´s skulls!  It was difficult to meditate near them. I opened my eyes to see who was sitting beside me emitting such a heavy vibe. I saw who it was and then I saw Ramananda sitting on the other side of me at total peace. I closed my eyes and tried to forget about the other monks. I once again felt that lightness emanating from Ramananda like I remembered from 6 years earlier. It was a pleasant relief to know that there were still some yogis left in A.M.<br><br>The next morning he told me a story of how he was present when Anandamurti mentioned that he had created alternative movements in case the monastic institution of A.M. fails in its objective. Ramananda was amazed to see Anandamurti speaking to another, unknown person in great detail about some other organization that Ramananda had never heard of. Ramananda was next to Anandamurti almost 24 hours a day and could not conceive of how such clandestine activities were possible. He told me this story and then looked at me intently and said, “you know, we really could fail.”<br><br>I was shocked. Why had he told me this? Nobody in A.M. spoke in that manner. Anandamurti was the incarnation of god and the monastics were chosen to propagate his mission over the entire planet. This was the common discourse, anyway. And why was he speaking to me so sincerely about this? He really didn’t even know me, at least in the common sense of having spent time with somebody and shared experiences, etc. However, I realized that he trusted me as much as I trusted him, and that he too felt a deep connection with me ever since our first encounter. It was so obvious he was telling me something more, but what was he saying?<br><br>Later that night I practiced my meditation. I knew that some really good energy had jumped over to me through Ramananda. I could feel that the gurus blessing was transmitted through him, as if Anandamurti had left a package with him to deliver to me in the right moment. I start to hear the OM sound more loudly than ever before, as if somebody had started up a motorcycle inside the house. I fell over in a trance for I don’t know how long. I heard OM for 3 days and hardly slept. It was perfect bliss. I could see my future unfolding before me and knew that the principles of A.M. would continue despite what happened to the organization. It was all very mystical. I understood I was to take radical measures regarding A.M., and prepare for its absolute disintegration. I knew I should undertake an alternate path to help preserve the ideals of A.M. It was all so lucid, and only becomes more so as the years pass on and I recall those realizations. Ramananda never gave orders, he only gave me his trust. He knew all would be well. It was one of the clearest and simplest heart connections I have ever had with another human being.</p>\n<p>That was written over 10 years ago.  Now it is almost embarrasing to associate my memories with Ananda Marga.  However, Ramananda did say that the organization would fall apart and he never did say what was to replace it.  All I have been able to do is to try to preserve the spirit of the ideology in novel manifestations that have no links to Ananda Marga whatsoever.  It is ridiculous to think that the evolution of the planet and human society should halt just because a human organization has disintegrated.  The spirit of dharma moves onward.  </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>While I was a student at The University of Texas at Austin, there was a story passing through the psychology department of how a group of drunken fraternity boys  pushed a piano through a window that fell 10 floors and killed 2 people in the street below. All of these bone-heads got together and decided they were not responsible. They collectively blamed the victims. “Why were those stupid people walking the streets at 3 am?” they argued.<br><br>We marveled at this phenomenon of “cognitive dissonance.” Cognitive dissonance is a mental state that occurs when there is a major contradiction in the habitual thought structures of the ego. The ego seeks consistency with its thoughts and projections so that there is a centered and consistent self-concept.  A powerful event that is different and contradicts the projections of its habitual reality creates a state of dissonance and inner tension in the mind. Instead of being only superficial and frivolous boys, they are now guilty of killing innocent people. They thought they were good people, perhaps the best, and now they are seen as criminals. To neutralize this cognitive dissonance, this state of tension induced by a great contradiction and confusion to the ego’s reality, one has to invent excuses that serve the confused ego and create an acceptable story so that one can continue thinking in the same way as before so that one’s projections about oneself and one’s “reality” are not contradicted and interrupted. The defensive and guilty psyche must avoid at all costs this painful state of cognitive dissonance. We are all cognitive misers and always look for easy excuses and pretexts rather than the complex truth. If you can not find an excuse, then you live in torment. In the case of frat boys, they can not bear the social censure and personal guilt and simply pass the blame on some “other”. This is, of course, much easier when each individual has the rest of the “team” supporting him.<br><br>These superficial socialites with the Greek letters were often conformist nationalistic and patriotic types that become model citizens and leaders in capitalist society.  Very few individuals on our planet are given the privileges and liberties of these fraternity boys. Although this is an extreme example of selfishness and a complex and contradictory self-serving bias, the irresponsibility and selfishness of these students really reflect the mentality and biases of materialistic, capitalist society in general.  Western capitalist countries have committed mass genocide all over the world and have interfered in the natural evolution of so many cultures and still continue to subjugate and exploit them.  Within those imperialist societies there is also so much exploitation, inequality, and injustice.  The frat boys tried to blame their victims to justify their own irresponsibility. Similarly, the the entire collective mentality of a society can be manipulated by the media spin-doctors, priests and politicians to become bigoted or racist and blame social problems on the poor, the blacks, latinos, or some other people in another country.  And if we are about to invade another country for their natural resources we can generate a nationalistic and xenophobic sentiment to justify ourselves and thereby placate our cognitive dissonance.  <br><br>Under the shadow of materialism, we live more separated and isolated and care mostly about our own selfish well-being, or perhaps only our near and dear ones. The dominant stream of materialistic culture fosters desires that are based mostly in material comfort, and so often tend towards excess.  Few think about the consequences of such a life-style; the environmental degradation, economic exploitation of other people on the planet, and widespread degeneration of the human soul trapped in this materialistic, deterministic cage that so much of our world has become. Not many people are concerned about economically motivated wars motivated by our military-industrial complex that undermine democracy by sabotaging the economies and governments of weaker nations.  Such destructive acts against humanity create psycho-social illnesses.  Our entire society has become mentally ill as we have distorted our most fundamental human values by accepting militant nationalism, multinational corporate domination, and lies like Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Irak.  And now with Trump are constantly forced (at least if we are honest) to see how our society so often goes against democracy and humanism, while at the same time we try and maintain the idea that we are the most just and democratic.  <br><br>Most of us are just like repressed frat boys on the inside. We ignore the reality of our immediate community, society and our planet and prefer to watch TV and buy strange things to fill our spiritual and existential emptiness. Nobody will criticize me if everyone is living in the same way, each in our own island.  It can not be bad if everyone else is part of the scheme, if some narcissistic and selfishly biased ideals give one an opiate to filter anything that may create the cognitive dissonance when one realizes that all of this makes one really unhappy. One can buy something new to fill an inner void, seek some adventure to divert the ego when it is bored and empty.  Or when Conscience begins to tell you that your world is destructive one may continue trying to raise the flag a little higher than one’s cognitive dissonance.  Our selfishness, conformity, laziness and ignorance enables individuals and society to continue their impunity and irresponsibility while we remain existentially dazed and psychologically divided.<br><br>Our mundane and selfish mentality will not take responsibility for the damage that it is creating all around the world. Most people trapped in materialism do not care so much about what happens to people in other places, as long as they continue to live in material comfort. Their biased ideological distortions and selfishness hide the ugly truth that our imbalanced socio-economic system must steal the natural resources and brutally exploit the labor of others in far away lands, and even create wars to do so.  This predatory lifestyle is responsible for so much destruction and suffering for the rest of the planet and its people. Under globalist capitalism, the first world is the parasite of the third.<br><br>Personally, I have received great benefits from being born in the first world: a good family, education and a safe environment in which to live. However, things change when one peers out of the false security bubble of a world that is really only sustained by perpetual violence, exploitation, and political subterfuge. One begins to look outside of the box to find true human culture and spirituality.  With humane culture, art, literature and meditation one develops a natural, spiritual and universal consciousness. It is natural that one’s socio-spiritual awareness expands and one begins to see and understand the terrible things that the politicians, bankers and corporations are doing to the world. So that a few can live in wretched excess, the masses of humanity have to live in misery. And for what end? The modern materialistic society of the U.S. and Europe is so full of mental pathologies that people often end up suffering more than the oppressed and exploited in the third world. Often I see more light in the eyes of the indigenous who live under tin roofs in the mountains than in the people of modern suburbs where I grew up. Though poor and forgotten, at least those people still have a piece of land and have not been forced into overcrowded urban slums to be devoured by the capitalist matrix. There are still people who are truly of this earth.<br><br>However, this situation is an absurd instability that can not last. The people whose profession is to lie and create war and destruction are in a deep part of their psyche actually well aware of the weaknesses in their networks of lies. No matter how sick and distorted their minds have become there is always a live witness that sees through their game of lies. They are not dumb beasts, but degenerate intellectuals ridden with extreme cognitive dissonance. There remains some portion of an inner awareness that makes them uneasy and restless within as they continue to trap themselves in exponentially greater lies without.<br><br>Whether we are speaking of the corruption and exploitation in our government, religion, or social group, the dynamics of power and mental manipulation within these distinct structures share a common psychological ground. We enter this world weak and ignorant and we require much struggle and effort to overcome these debilities, whether they be physical, mental, or spiritual weaknesses.  Some people are more strong while others are weak, some are more sharp and others are dull.  The strong  lead or control the weak. Such is the law of nature at all levels: physical, mental, and spiritual. The only problem with this law is how we define “strength” and “weakness” and how people are treated in accordance with those definitions.  When leaders become too empowered and selfish, they begin to exploit their followers economically, socially, and ideologically.  Eventually their dogmas, prejudices, policies become completely corrupt and go against the common good.  Then begins the process of  manipulation that trick us into believing and following something we should not.  And finally tyranny and repression toward all who resist their hypocrisy and impunity.  This cycle causes untold harm to individuals and just as certainly as it brings death to empires.  This is essentially the same pattern for all types of social manipulation and spin-doctoring whether we are speaking of the exploitation of the ignorant and weak by the shrewd and strong in the religious, economic, cultural, racial or class structures.<br><br>When rational and moral human beings are forced to believe in something irrational and immoral, we become existentially confused and psychologically fragmented.  We are overcome by cognitive dissonance. We can never develop a clear picture of reality because the cognitive models we acquire about ourselves and our worlds are so often very contradictory. From the yogic point of view, the Aham or feeling of “I am” can never reconcile itself with the Mahat, the pure feeling of “I exist” which is eternal and pure and unconditioned by the external world. The “I-am” or ego is midway between the inner and outer worlds and so is in part socially conditioned. It is not really separated from the Mahat within, only limited definitions of the ego make it appear as such. Without progressive spiritual culture we are stuck in an imposed and warped definition of the “I am” that doesn’t permit us to see the true “I” within.<br><br>The victims of cognitive dissonance imposed by the priests or the politicians are always ready, in their confusion and dissonance, to accept some story that makes sense.  Weak and separated from inner truth, we are all too ready to believe in some explanation.  The trembling masses accept the stories prefabricated for them that only further sustain the mental exploitation and control over them.  This is the perfect state of control over a social body:  we fear them, yet we simultaneously seek their approval and protection. With such a fear complex imposed by institutions it is no wonder that few people ever find a way out of this web of maya, or cosmic delusion created by errant human minds.<br><br>Dogmatic ideology would have that or mental development remain in the lower rungs of the Aham or ego, far away from the self-reliant and vastly intelligent qualities of the Mahat or true “I” within.  This is a natural human duality that dogmatic ideology tries to exploit by keeping us enslaved to matter and the market, to class and color, or perhaps within some church with some savior.  We become neurotic individually and collectively as a result. Some people may not be strong enough to protest and take a stand. This is unfortunate because the exploiters and perpetrators usually continue in their downward fall into even more gross and perverse actions which require even more cover-ups.  Such is the self-condemning path of the lie; one has to keep lying to cover up previous lies until eventually one is trapped in an inescapable quagmire of psychotic non-reality.<br><br>If we combat these universal thought distortions of power and manipulation and understand how they work, then we will have taken at least a chunk out of the monstrous structures of power that we humans create and carry in our mind-body system, in our DNA. Only by finding discernment, the perfect balance of universal love and reason, will we be able to remedy our frailty and lack of true faith in our inherent power of reason and love.  This fault has permitted us to accept the lies and manipulations of others. The infinite Consciousness is beyond name and form, freely available to all.  It lies with our own “I-feeling” or Mahat.  These warped beliefs were created in our weak egos by spiritual scheisters;  they fermented there because we couldn’t see an alternative, we couldn’t conceive of something higher, or the belief gave a false sense of security. It is only in this confused mental space that the powers that be can impose their dogmas.  Our pinnacled reason and moral responsibility must dissolve these false mental structures that only serve to make us all ill. As such we may begin to purify the collective consciousness of humanity.<br><br>To reflect and resound these lies back to them is the duty of all who love liberty and seek a better and more balanced world. Leaders play the game of psychological terror, as well as actual, aggressive terror. Should we not find a more subtle and intelligent way to return this package? Should we not rise above their petty little ideologies and feelings with the highest universal humanism and spiritual strength to reflect their hell back upon them? Make the mind a laser that penetrates through this darkness to send this mass of foul lies back to the perpetrators. This refined interior tantric light will protect you personally and help repel their attacks on our collective human society. We must tap our reserve forces in the deepest part of the mind to defend against this degeneration and impunity. Neurosis and psychosis is the natural result of most people who do not renounce the path of lies and destruction. Let them destroy themselves rather than others. The stronger you are as a universal human being, the more their own distortions fall back upon them. There is some good that torments this fragmented and sick state of existence.  Their weakness is in the same point as their cognitive dissonance and false consciousness. What does the shrewd capitalist know of the greater forces in the universe, these brutes who exploit and kill for finite matter, poor ideology and petty ego? Perhaps some will change, but most eventually be devoured by their own psychopathology because of such internal distortion. They are cunning, but a deeper moral intelligence connects us to true power and knowledge in the universe. They do not know the power of Tao, of dharma, the universal moral order of the universe. A mind without spiritual awareness is like a ship lost at sea, full of holes, and sinks slowly.  <br><br>The leaders and also their followers also carry the burden of truth through the lie. Those who accept the popular lies also pay the price in the end. Although most are not aware that they are ultimately working towards truth, even through their own degeneration. The materialistic and narcissistic example of existence with all its psychopathology has given proof to the world of its non-sustainability and its inevitable madness. This giant collapsing on itself is teaching many lessons to the world of how not to live.  Do people still perceive the subtle, yet inviolable law of compensation? The collective “karma” of a society affects all of its members. The universe holds all individuals accountable, those who lives in conformity, pays taxes, and pledge allegiance to such a monster. Here I recall the stoic philosopher Diogenes who roamed about in broad daylight with a lantern saying he was looking for honest men.<br><br>There is very little moral order left in human society at this end of this capitalist era. The planet is being ravaged and is being coerced out of balance by human activity. The social order is descending into chaotic, brutal anarchy. The shrewd and powerful just do what they want and make laws to justify and implement their policies based on their exclusive interests. Corporations and governments become organized crime institutions under the hegemony of the global capitalist system. Multi-national corporations, federal reserve banks and their military industrial complex continue killing and/or controlling us all. Under the holocaust of globalization, the survivors are being forced to live off of the blood and sweat of others. Without great lies and psychological tricks of self-deception, very few people now live in good conscience. The first world is the parasite of the third world and the globalist legislation is but a low argument for parasitism. What is nature’s response to our civilizations downward slide? Will we be shrugged off of the planet by the protective forces of nature? If all is already brutal anarchy and the world only continues to slide into greater darkness and destruction, then why not consider a higher form of anarchy?<br><br>Advaita, the philosophy of Oneness, is pure freedom, spiritual anarchy. Not even the best ideas control the mind under this philosophy, much less governments or institutions. The idea of Oneness of spirit in all beings, an “Oversoul” behind all particular minds, reveals the greatest inner freedom and bliss. At the same time this vision inspires a sacred duty toward ethical action in harmony with this common spirit. Instead of promoting and projecting an immature and selfish bourgeois freedom, one’s conscience demands truth in all aspects of existence. Without the torch of conscience, lies and delusion distort one’s freedom and make mundane, dualistic existence a cage for the soul. Congruence with one’s deepest conscience and holding to it under all circumstances is the greatest defense against dualistic, separate thinking and all of its manifestations in our human world. Spiritual anarchy, the spontaneous, natural, and intuitive order and organization stemming from a state of social and existential chaos, has its roots in a profound respect for other beings that transcends name and form. Spirituality must be a truly unitive force instead of a divisive one. If it is true, then there are good fruits for all. If untrue, then it poisons the minds of individuals and creates disunity in the world. A newer, more conscious form of humanism may begin to evolve as Shakti, the divine force of nature, molds us into a higher form of being. Whatever doesn’t evolve toward this practical ideal of Advaita, of essential oneness with the Infinite, is ultimately crushed under the wheels of the gods as divine mother nature (Shakti) reclaims all of these errant expressions through her destructive and regenerative forces.<br><br>Dogmatism and religion have little to do with dharma, which is the “essential” purpose of a human being. They are static containers of dead ideas, like garbage bins. Dharma is an ideological flow of evolution through thought and action and really takes you somewhere and causes a stir of movement deep in the soul. Dharma refers to the state of spiritual freedom whereby one is only capable of following nature’s laws and a spiritual way of life. If one lives more by the laws of spirit than by customs, then religion, politics, and social conventions are mostly lies and weak prompts for desperate or blind mentalities that haven’t found their place here on earth. Existential and social alienation create a state of spiritual ignorance which make one vulnerable to the many snares of dualistic thinking.<br><br>Our lack of mindful awareness makes space for a whole host of foolish ideologies.  Egoism is for infants. Materialism is for brutes and Barbies. Racism and imperialism are for Neanderthals. Nationalism is but a reunion of Cro-mags. Religion mostly just keeps people from having to face hard truths themselves, and thereby take a leap of faith by sheepishly following the established ideas of others. Spiritual anarchists like Thoreau, Aurobindu and Tolstoy could not be contained within the confines of social convention and corrupt substitutes for dharma. Instead, they sought a higher union with both Nature and society and offered something new and bold for humanity. In this day and age it is hard to have faith in “systems” that don’t sprout up from a natural order based on local necessity. Spiritual visionaries have always and will always respond to the needs of their local human and natural environments and offer a new vision for the world inspired by the genius of eternal dharma. These practical examples show how some great truths are implemented through the most practical and humane expressions.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>January 2021</p>\n<p>People are essentially the same everywhere. Only externally we appear so different. Everywhere you go in the world you find the same basic virtues as well as the same scandals. Human beings create the same gods and devils all around the globe. Perhaps the particular society in which one lives follows cyclical paths of ups and downs and the people rise and fall accordingly, but it always happens to human beings in very similar ways.</p>\n<p>Vivekananda, the first yogi to visit the Western world, was speaking of the relative, cyclical nature of social evolution to the intellectual elite of England and boldly said that when India was at its height as a civilization the Britons were painting their bodies blue and living in trees.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\">Only political and materialistic opportunists who promote fear in the ignorant and fearful people focus more on people´s differences than people´s similarities. Nationalism, even in more responsible and rational forms, has always seemed rather immature compared to the perennial idea that we are all microcosmic consciousness evolving and existing in the living and vibrant Macrocosmic Consciousness of the universe.  <br>  <br>The subjective Consciousness is the same in all beings. We may have different minds, but the internal \"I\" is identical in all. It is only in the objective part of our minds that we are different. The objective mind (chitta) is connected to the external world and the physical brain and so it therefore is qualified by external objectivity. If one sees only the external, then all appears different. People are simply conditioned and qualified by different environments and objective circumstances like race, culture and social class. However, if one knows the pure, inner Consciousness, then one realizes that the internal, subjective Consciousness is the same in the divine Macrocosm as well as all individual beings, or \"microcosms.\" All beings share the same inner soul with the infinite subjective Consciousness, or Macrocosm.  The microcosm and Macrocosm are essentially united.  Really, there is only a Macrocosmic Mind and Consciousness. \"Microcosm\" is actually a misnomer; it is used to describe a mind qualified by relative, changing objectivity, the part of one´s subjective consciousness that appears to be qualified and changed by the external world.  Yet this consciousness is never really modified. It is like a mirror reflecting so many objects. No matter how many objects and colors that are reflected in the mirror the mirror never changes.   <br><br>I listened to an interview with Cornel West the other night. I cannot say I have read his works but his interviews have always impressed me. What most illuminated me from this interview were his reflections on how the Neo-liberal Left and the Neo-Fascist Right are controlled by the same big interests in Wall Street and the Military Industrial Complex. Both sides serve the American Empire, only the Left wants to let minorities and women into the game while the Right maintains a more traditional racist attitude. He spoke at length about how people are never introduced, even in universities, to the idea that the U.S. is an empire with a history of colonialism, genocide, and capitalist exploitation.  <br>  <br>Reflecting on this interview I begin to think of a person whose image I always try to keep out of my mind, the “Neo-Fascist” leader that West refers to. I only recently heard his voice and listened to this person speak. I feel at one with world but there are still people whose mental form is so disturbing that I do not want to let them anywhere near my soul by even thinking of them. When we conjure up a person or object in our minds there is actually a connection with the original object or person. Weak and unconscious minds only see their own projections and have very little connection with the original object in their minds. The stronger and purer the mind, the more one is able to connect with the person.  <br>  <br>Trump is the supreme and perfect example of “white trash.” “White trash” is a term I stopped using some time ago, at least until now. It seemed rather racist in that it implies that white people can also be “trash,” not just the minorities so commonly discriminated against. Also, its common use to describe rural and simple folk is truly offensive. I cannot even use the term \"white trash\" for fearful and violent, gun-slinging fundamentalist Christians.  These people have inferiority complexes that are exploited by their leaders who inject a false sense of national and racial superiority.  I can only call their leaders \"white trash.\"  Trump is the perfect symbol of collective ignorance and brutality, the perfect leader for a trash culture in a trash empire. Only trashy, crude, materialistic consciousness could manifest this abomination.  <br><br><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/white-trash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-xs.jpg 640w ,file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-sm.jpg 768w ,file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-md.jpg 1024w ,file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-lg.jpg 1366w ,file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-xl.jpg 1600w ,file:///home/w/Documentos/Publii/sites/william-enckhausen/input/media/posts/35/responsive/white-trash-2xl.jpg 1920w\"></figure>  <br>Such distortions of human consciousness that endanger our evolution are always eventually cursed by nature and the Macrocosm itself turns against them. Nature simply unleashes all of the accumulated reactions to the past actions of the collective consciousness with such perfect precision and even uncanny symbolism so as to make it clear to history that what was destroyed was an abomination. Hopefully, now I can remove this form from my mind but I do in some strange way thank Trump for beings such a clear and perfect symbol. The American Empire will not be spared the fate of other fallen empires who no longer serve any evolutionary purpose.  <br>  <br>I recently dreamed that I was hiking to the North Pole with ex-president Obama.  He was asking me some questions about yoga philosophy.  I did not want to talk to him.  I thought internally that \"you might be a decent fellow if you weren´t the leader of the corporate empire, the war machine of the military industrial complex, etc.etc....  I said nothing.    <br>  <br>In the dream I was aware it was a dream and was thinking I am dreaming this because in my past, after the Purulia incident, I was always in playful dialogues with very \"intelligent\" people.   <a href=\"https://williamenck.art/the-debate/\">I had an eye kept on me but I was an innocent person in the debacle</a> and I felt that the intelligence and military people I dialogued with were genuinely friendly with me.  They knew I was no patriot but also understood that I was not an anarchist or violent revolutionary.  I took advantage of the situation to give them some subtle moral clashes about being servants of the war machine.  I wondered that if they woke up a little spiritually and morally if they would end up renouncing their government and military positions?  For example, I once dialoged with a navy officer and West Point professor about neo-platonic ideas and their similarity with the Upanashadic doctrine of the identity of the Atman with Brahman.  This is essentiall the same debate of the Christian mystics as to if the human soul is at one with and identical to God, or if it was a separate entity than the divine essence.  He cited John Scotus Eriugena.  We spoke about whether the Atman, the individual soul, was equal to Brahman, the universal soul.  I said it was true and he asked if it were true in the sense of the two cantaloupes he was holding were identical.  Are they identical, or just similar?, he asked.  I said that there is nothing exactly similar in the physical plane but in the spirit all is one.  It would be as if two cantaloupes could be exactly identical.  If they were completely identical then we could not notice their separateness under any scrutiny and they would be entirely one.  Such coincidence is impossible in the physical world but in the spirit all is one.  However, in the physical world we should see unity in diversity, as finite and diverse creation trying to express the Infinite through the evolution of consciousness, I said.  <br>  <br>Anyway, it was my personal little history of being able to see how people inside the both sides of the eternal game of rebels and empire officials really think, as human beings.  And so with this in my mind I realized that this was the reason that in this dream I was supposed to guide him to the north pole.  Obama in this dream is definitely the most refined symbol of great human intellect enslaved to dirty politics, in the end a false humane and rational face for the most irrational and self-destructive empire.    <br>  <br>Continuing with the dream, we reached the tip of the world.  The North Pole was directly in the middle of what seemed to be an igloo.  On approaching it closer the igloo was really a pool.  It was covered from the weather and there was a small door on this roof to enter the waters below.  Obama asked me to open it.  I saw the waters were deep and connected to the oceans all around this block of ice we were standing on top of.  Obama asked to look in and I moved aside.  The waters started swirling and the entire pool became a giant vortex.  A giant wave engulfed him and I watched him get flushed.  The vortex grew and engulfed the entire north pole and I saw the entire human society getting flushed as well.  I was wondering why I was not getting flushed but realised I was just a witness without a physical body in this dream.  <br>  <br>Rightist, leftist; capitalist, communist:  If your philosophy is matter then in the end you really do not matter.  Matter is an illusion, people only believe in it when their spiritual heart is not yet open.  Universal reason cannot be separated from universal love.    <br>  <br>Over the last 500 years it has been demonstrated that the capitalist system cannot survive without genocide, slavery, and a multinational imperialism which exploits human labor and hoards natural resources stolen from other lands. Communism, which was born as the bastard son and counter-reaction to capitalism, has mostly fallen short of its ideals when put into practice. Instead of a liberated proletariat and the dissolution of the state, we find tyrannical central governments that grossly oppress human rights. Capitalism seeks to bind with gold chains while communism binds with heavy iron chains. Neither system helps all of humanity evolve physically, mentally, or spiritually.  <br>  <br>If there are parasites that attack the physical organism, then why cannot there exist parasites that attack the mental organism? Just as parasites can root their way into an imbalanced and infirm organism, then why could not a mental parasite worm its way into an infirm mind, or ideologies that create mental imbalances? Perhaps limited, materialistic ideas like capitalism and communism are destined to make both the individual and collective minds insane because they are limited ideologies based on materialism and only recognise the material and social nature of human beings. A human being desires infinite freedom. Not only do we desire freedom, but we are designed to seek it. There exist within us all of the thought forms and emotional structures to seek higher mental and spiritual forms of happiness. The common error is to seek the infinite in the finite. If our infinite desires situate themselves exclusively in creature comforts and egocentric desires, then frustration and unhappiness will eventually destroy this limited happiness as one´ś higher nature has not been expressed.  <br>  <br>These mental parasites are called microvita in tantra yoga. Just like there are positive as well as negative bacterias, there are both positive and negative microvita. Positive microvita stimulate the higher desires of the mind and the endocrine system while negative microvita keep the mind bound to our animal nature. There is always a balance of positive and negative microvita in nature but when negative microvita become overly expressed and positive microvita are not expressed, then great imbalances occur and nature must restore order. A human being that does not participate in physical, mental and spiritual evolution is a waste of energy and will be attacked by negative microvita. The planet must get rid of some dead weight. Ideologies that mold human beings into slaves of matter will eventually be flushed by nature as they do not foster the evolution of spirit.  <br>  <br>The mind is the intermediary entity between spirit and matter. \"As you think, so you become.\" The mind becomes like the objects of its attachments. Subtle occupations of the mind make the mind finer while crude occupations degrade the mind. If the ego, the driver of the mind, is weak then negative microvita help make one selfish and mean minded, seeks creature comforts and dreams of getting rich, and attaining only mundane ambitions. If one is strong and intelligent then positive microvita helps one to struggle for liberation from all mental limitations and ultimately finds peace in the infinite spirit within. When the mind unifies with spirit it is nirvana, freedom from time and rebirth. The mind no longer exists as a separate entity: it merges into spirit. When one defies one´s true purpose of dharma (the path of physical and mental evolution toward spiritual freedom) the mind unifies with matter. In this union one is also free from human rebirth: the mind disintegrates in matter, the body dies, and one becomes one with the garbage on the streets and the caca in the sewers.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>This is a recent commentary and edition on <a href=\"https://williamenck.art/the-debate\">The Debate. </a></p>\n<p>I look back on all of this as a really humorous experience.  For me it was the Cosmic Theater Of The Absurd.  It was if the master crafter of all souls fused together Samuel Beckett and Peter Sellers to create The Arms Drop.  One night, just after being released from a dirty Indian prison and being placed under house arrest at the A.M. compound, there were rumors that the drums we were hearing were war drums.  There were similar drums many years before when the Bengali Communist government gave the locals alcohol, money and weapons to attack the Ananda Marga monks.  They killed six of them one day and had killed another 100 over the next two decades, according to the A.M. monks.  So there really was reason to be alarmed.  The monks were running for the trains to leave but we were under house arrest and could not leave.  Some monks told us just to make a run to the Nepal border any way we could.  I said we would be state fugitives.  The monk said that at least we would be alive and have a chance.</p>\n<p>We still did not know that Ananda Marga was really behind the arms drop.  That came later.  I was being used as a poster boy of innocence and the leaders of AM put me in front of the press to tell my story.  It worked well and we became like local celebrities as people recognized us in public and wanted to meet us because we were \"famous.\"  I think that many really had hoped we were really insurrectionists.   Later, the world discovers the truth after some true culprits were arrested.  It turns out that some A.M. monks bought some weapons in Bulgaria and tried to bring them into India.  The plan was discovered by Interpol and the British MI5 and the whole plot was foiled.  Ananda Marga was seen as a terrorist organization.  So there was all the more need to make some positive propaganda to make AM more favorable in the public eye to prevent an attack from the Bengali communists.  Little did I know I was being used as a pawn in an  insurrection against the Bengali communist regime.  <br><br>Even though we had been through so much stress by being so affected by some international coup against the Bengali Communists and under threat of an attack with spears, bows and arrows by some tribal people, our spirits were very high. We had nothing else to do under house arrest but meditate a lot and we were all really very high.  My friends and I made jokes most of that night about how we were going to survive the night.  They said the Texan (myself)should turn our hostel into the Alamo and make one last brave stand like Davy Crocket and the boys, using the guns we were accused of smuggling into the country.  I said that because we were already accused of being terrorists then we should just put panty hose over our heads and just be so freaky that the locals would be scarred of us and run away thinking we were demons.  We knew nothing would happen to us and nothing did.  </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//pantyhose.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-xs.jpg 640w ,https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-sm.jpg 768w ,https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-md.jpg 1024w ,https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-lg.jpg 1366w ,https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-xl.jpg 1600w ,https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-2xl.jpg 1920w\"></figure>\n<p><br>Actually, there was a documentary about those events but I could never see it on servers in the U.S. or even in Mexico.  This was just a few years ago, 25 years after The Arms Drop occurred.  One had to use a VPN to see the free documentary online.  Like me, the documentary questioned why the US government was so interested in that affair.  At the same time some Indian journalists, authors, and film-makers interviewed me because they had read The Debate.  I was hoping that their work would not be overly serious nor factual and intellectual, that the movie would have at least some dancing at the end.  All of the main characters in many Indian movies, friend and foe, dance together at the end.  Just imagine those orange-clad clowns dancing with AK47´s while the CIA and MI5 agents boogie alongside them!  I would be brake-dancing.</p>",

            "content_html": "<figure class=\"post__image\">Human life is always at balance between inferiority and superiority complexes. We make so many mistakes based on such complexes, dominating others or submitting to the domination of others. However, one day we have to wake up, have true confidence and be more authentic without these games of inferiority or superiority, without harming others and ourselves.<br><br>When one can see ones own mind without negative or positive prejudices or distortions one begins to see ones whole world without these distortions as well. One stops having opinions about other people’s characteristics and can really see what their minds are like with their past and present thoughts and emotions. All that the awakened mind sees are the dynamics of actions and reactions of minds. The previous actions have built a reality in the present and the actions of the present will create a reality for the future. It does not matter if one dies in debt of previous actions because they continue attached to the mind and the soul and seek to be reborn in the human body to pay those debts in another incarnation. Everything that one brings from genetic inheritance and the conditions of the environment of birth have been a result of previous actions, chosen by one. No one is the victim of an arbitrary chance. The conscious Macrocosm does not play dice as humans do. Some say that the soul always chooses its incarnations in the phase between death and rebirth. I think that this is so but also what the conscious macrocosm gives us precisely for balancing our previous actions, whether we want it and accept it or not. All who are incarnated on earth have debts with the universe and will be paid by us. In the end no one escapes the law of compensation, of action and reaction, or karma and samskara.<br><br>A yogi once stated that the power of spirit is so real that if one is bit by a poisonous snake but with firm determination says “I am not poisoned” then one will not become sick. Only because something is difficult to understand for the masses does not make it untrue. This yogi understood higher laws but the lot of humanity live in materialistic and deterministic ignorance. The discovery of higher psyco-spiritual laws make so many physical determinants vacuous and vaporous, and make our modern science shallow and our medicine so crude. I have seen so many times how so called incurable diseases like cancer and AIDS have been eradicated by a radical, spiritual change of consciousness. People gained a little bit of spiritual, vertical insight into their illness and understood the deeper reasons and were cured. Perhaps few can comprehend this but that does not make it untrue.<br><br>The physical world is a product of Spirit. We create realities based on our limited mental projections and these projections always bounce back as our karmic reactions and such frustrations only serve to strengthen these cognitive barriers. We continue believing that these personal and collective projections are absolute until some great clash awakens our spirit and broadens our mental projections. I am not saying that viruses, deadly illnesses or poisons are not real, only that they exist on a cruder plane of reality. Change the mind and you change the body. Change the mind and you change the world.<br><br>The key to a strong immune system is a strong mind. What is immunity but the ability of the organism to distinguish between what is me and what is not me? At the mental level this distinction of self and not self corresponds to moral discernment. One knows who one is and what are one´s personal boundaries. Most people are confused about such questions and simply let others decide what is best for them. They place too much faith in their pastors, their doctors or their favourite authors or even actors. A strong and insightful mind with discernment knows the inner labyrinths of the mind, the weaknesses and pitfalls of the self and therefore self deception is more difficult. So much mental confusion due to self ignorance creates a state of constant tension and stress and the physical immune system is also weakened by this lack of discernment.<br><br>Biopsychology is not an abstract and intellectual science for the tantric yogi. It is an intuitive science based on direct experience. One enters into the Anahata Vortex or Heart Chakra and becomes one with the heart of the universe. From this center one connects with the Aerial Factor, the subtle vibrations of prana that radiate through the entire universe. Every human mind is a potential portal for this connection if only the desires of the mind are purified from narrow-mindedness and selfishness. When the mind vibrates with universal love and spiritual union there is a warm glow in the chest. One feels the physical heart very calm and also feels the thymus gland as a very soft radiation of soothing energy. All internal sufferings are healed and the radiation from this mind also affects the Anahata Vortex and the organs corresponding to that vortex in other beings. The yogi becomes first at one with the universe and enters the universal heart and naturally radiates this calm to others.<br><br>In meditation we learn to bring the mind to a small point inside the pineal gland, so small it becomes infinitesimal. All contents of the mind are brought to this sacred space and handed over in simple confidence that they will be received.  Any fragmented and splintered part of the self brought into this space resounds back into spiritual life as resplendence.  This flow of thought from the finite mind into the infinite consciousness makes one more and more conscious and one actually becomes the witness consciousness. The mind gets lost in essence.  Consciousness is not an action of the mind but rather the essence of it.  The mind takes the ideation of pure and infinite consciousness and actually becomes pure and infinite consciousness. I become nothing and desire nothing as the Infinite being takes this mind back into its essence.  I let it worry about who I am and what I will do in this world.  All of the sorrows of life that are clearly reconciled with the infinite no longer bind one and joy begins to emerge from all of those once dark places.  The union of the mind with infinity is not a mere philosophical concept, but a lived experience in the eternal now.  Joy and the full acceptance of relative existence are the end product, the final proof of the evolution of our minds and selves towards pure and infinite Consciousness. <br><br>I have known yogis whose universal love and power of discernment was so strong that they could heal others. Their immunity was so strong that they could take on the weight of others. They were liberated from their own actions and reactions and lived freely united with the divine macrocosm. Some had the ability to heal others spiritually, taking their karmic reactions of others into their own mind so that others can advance on the spiritual path. Although they were saints and had a lot of spiritual grace accompanying them, they had to pay debts as if they were their own debts. Action and reaction are mechanical forces that even God cannot change. God only guides us how to get out of our web of karma and if God himself were to take human form to atone for our reactions, then god would have to pay the debt in flesh and blood as well. My yogi friends suffered a lot doing this work. In fact, they sacrificed their lives so that others could come out of the darkness. Some were stronger and able to move more people while others could only help a few people, but they did so with a force beyond the personal mind, or microcosmic mind. They had the grace to understand and use the forces of the Macrocosmic mind. However, they all suffered personally in this process even though they had the strength and spiritual perspective to endure the pain, not fall, and actually digest and transmute what they took from others. Living and studying with them, I saw this dynamic up close and asked many questions. My first book, A Name To The Nameless, was an attempt to explain the dynamics of the mind from this point of view, albeit abstracted from personal context and explained in the theoretical format of the psychology of tantra yoga. I tried to remove my personal opinions and experiences from the writing and focus on the psychological and spiritual processes of the mind. My purpose was to map the soul and mind to help others understand their patterns of action and reaction, or karma and samskara. My second book, Microvita And Tantra Maya, was more personal, in the first person, writing about personal experiences and my opinions. My third book, Light And Dark Tantra, is about my friends and teachers and the tragedy that happened when they died and their spiritual society lost their benevolent influence.<br><br>After one begins to meditate sincerely and feel that life is deeply full of meaning one understands that life is a process of liberation from emotional and cognitive bondages.  The individual is ultimately responsible for everything that happens and one´s inner attitudes and conditions determine what occurs in life.  It is no longer possible to blame anybody or anything for our existential and spiritual state of being when one begins to understand the law of action and reaction.  Instead, one is responsible for all of one´s past actions and the future requital of those actions and resigns to this universal law.  Only then can there be freedom, freedom from the past and freedom to act in the future without the cloudy disturbances of past complexes and fears distorting actions that generate negative reactions.  All spiritual people I know from all walks of life are on the path of this realization, no matter what their philosophies.  True spirituality connects one to the essence of life and the underlying spiritual laws that govern human existence and people who are aligned with the essence of their lives will always discover deeper, universal laws.  <br><br>If this understanding of self responsibility is realized to be true after one becomes spiritually mature, does it not also mean that the law of action and reaction was also active before one was aware of it?  All of the past suffering, inner chaos and disorder in life is not happenstance, but reactions to our previous actions.  It is a terribly heavy idea.  We often think of people as victims that have been treated unfairly in an unjust world where there is no real sense of order and justice.  And when the idea is presented that people are responsible for their own suffering sounds very cruel, like conservatives and racists that feel no sense of responsibility for  bettering the lives of the less fortunate.  I do not say that the law of karma should make one passive and insensitive to the suffering of others because \"they deserve it, karmically.\"  Rather, it is to note that while trying to help other people it is important to understand that a part of their being is deeply tied to their suffering and to try to liberate it is to entangle oneself with something much more complex than a difficult personal history or tragic social injustices that harm one and inhibit personal growth.  There is also the mental pattern that one carries into these situations, certain attitudes and charged mental forces that resonate with these individual and social circumstances.  Some self-destructive \"a priori\" mental pattern accompanies their lived experiences, pre-disposing them to some suffering in life.<br><br>Teaching meditation to me was always a great joy, although very difficult at times.  Some people just needed a little instruction and guidance and they advanced very well by their own discipline and inspiration.  The good results of just a little discipline  inspired them onward in their spiritual practice.  Having the perspective of remaining in the \"witness\" state of consciousness as they learned in meditation helped them understand the clashes that life would inevitably bring their way.  They could see the deeper meaning of a situation and the lesson to be learned because they were able to stay in a calm center and this state of calmness always guided one intuitionally through a situation.  And with each clash there is greater cohesion in the inner mind and an understanding of the laws of the mind and spirit.  Everybody gets stuck now and then but a good meditator usually finds the answers they need in their meditation but also by associating with like-minded people in a similar path.  We are all much more similar than different and people with a little more experience and time on the spiritual path can share their experiences with others to help guide them forward.  <br><br>Teaching people who are already in the process of \"self-actualization\" is all too easy.  They take on their own existential burdens.  However, not many people advance so easily.  Most carry more baggage and this is always more work for the teacher.  Many people need help and seek relief for their existential maladies, but not everybody is ready to go deeply into themselves via tantra yoga or other really strong approaches to meditation and spiritual discipline.  This is only possible by combining a lot of psychotherapy techniques along with the spiritual practices.  Some people may need something akin to therapy, others just need to talk and address their issues with a trusted guide, while some people just need to be inspired by some good ideas.  When one is in a spiritual society it is important that there is a culture of spirituality available to all with sufficient emotional and intellectual tools for the community.  <br><br>Unfortunately, this is where things become very difficult and where so many spiritual societies end up becoming religions or cults.  Instead of having effective techniques of spiritual practice there enter ideas of inclusiveness and privilege for those on the inside.  They follow behind some charismatic leader and instead of really doing their own inner work, they take refuge in the prestige of the teacher or their group.  They may learn the spiritual lingo and repeat it like parrots while trying to make an impression on newcomers.  Here, one simply develops the same prejudices in mundane social life that make the ego feel superior or empowered.  The underlying sense of inferiority is covered up by self aggrandizement but these complexes are never really transmuted.  Eventually all of these masks will fall and one is left even more lost and confused.  <br><br><br><img loading=\"lazy\"

1920w\"></figure><br><br>After 2012 and my writings about the narco war more people wanted to come into contact with me.  I was like a hermit who hardly left the desert where I had built my home and a small community.  I was working with an indigenous healer who saw herself as my manager and was jealous of anybody who became close to me, people who became my students and friends. Although quite an intuitive and effective healer, her emotional insecurities eventually got the best of her.<br><br>My friend was a very influential person with the Zapatistas.  She was deeply distressed by the sexual misconduct of the male leaders in the movement, namely those of Subcomandante Marcos.  She began to have deep resentments towards men, especially men in situations of power who had attractive qualities.<br><br>Also, the situation with a yoga society she was involved with started going down quickly.  I had left that society long ago but she still had some associations with them.  All we encountered were criminal and sexual scandals.  She became enraged over this and often her rage carried over to me, and perhaps even all men.  I became all the more the playboy in her mind each time she heard of these monastic scandals.  Later, when we began to encounter homosexual scandals with the monks, she really lost control. She never expressed hatred toward gays before this but later started to see homosexuals around every corner, and eyed them with hatred. <br><br>Eventually she started telling me that a group of students who are doctors helping the rural communities of Chiapas were really a band of sexual perverts and basically behaved like a group of Roman senators in togas.  This was her effort to get me to despise them.  I found it hard to believe.  Later, she started to accuse me of perversions and saying I was trying to manipulate people sexually.  Yet at the same time she went around praising me and telling people I was the incarnation of Quetzalcoatl.<br><br>I can sympathize with her anger toward \"machismo\" within and without of her yoga society.  I did not like it either.  It provoked a lot of repulsion in me too.  Repulsion is a subtle tendency (at the Vishuddha level).  Essentially, it is a protection of one´s discernment (Viveka) and keeps harmful expressions away.  There may be moral grounds to feel repulsion toward immoral activities that truly cause harm to people, yet one has to be careful not to fall into hatred.  Then, one´s heightened sense of morality can indeed become an expression of immorality if one begins to judge and slander other people.  Once hatred has taken hold of the mind then enters fear and paranoia.  To entertain such negative ideas and emotions in the mind actually makes the mind resonate with these energies.  Mind has the peculiar quality to become one with its objects of attachment.  The same negativity that one attaches to becomes part of one´s own mind. <br><br>Due to this I was forced to try and understand something I had not given a lot of effort to understanding.  I also saw many homosexual expressions as something really imbalanced, however, I really did not see them as so much different than heterosexual hyper sexuality in the form of \"free love\" and open sexual relationships.  Whether heterosexual or homosexual these sexual indulgences always create more suffering than pleasure and cause degeneration.  Unlike her, I could not condemn them but I tried to see their higher consciousness beyond their impulses and distortions.  One must understand that our social world is degenerated with so much narcissism, hedonism, materialism and hyper sexuality that create so many psychological complexes.  Also, I saw that there were more mature and responsible homosexuals that contained their sexual expressions with other homosexuals in a more responsible manner.  How could I condemn them if these homosexuals were even more responsible than heterosexuals who practiced the hypocrisy of \"free love\" and went around harming others with their selfish impulses? Yet on the other hand I cannot assert, as some religious homosexual activist do, that God simply made them that way.  I think if God were to create  homosexuals or guide evolution creatively, then such a God would have given more appropriate organs for homosexual expressions, especially with male homosexuals who practice sodomy.  The anus is simply an excretory organ that is not divinely designed for healthy sexual activity.  I certainly believe that divine compassion is for all and that God does not judge anybody for anything, but that homosexuality just like other human mental adjustments and complexes are of our own making, our own history of karmic actions and reactions. God has nothing to do with the creation of homosexuality yet divine compassion can touch and transform all parts of our being. <br><br>Also, some of her followers had certain homosexual confusions.  I saw them as heterosexuals with slight homosexual tendencies.  Intuitionally, I saw their minds had some strong complexes in the second chakra, the svadhistana.  I always saw that male homosexuals had two very strong propensities in the svadhistana:  lack of confidence and compulsion.  These emotional and energetic imbalances distort the svadhistana´s libido, cause the pranic or energetic flow of the mind to move downward (toward the first chakra), and overstimulate the first chakra by creating the confusion that the anus is an erogenous zone.  In the case of people with slight homosexual tendencies, they often resolved their homosexual tendencies by seeing these underlying complexes in their minds with the help of meditation, yoga exercises and the study of yogic bio psychology.  It certainly was not easy to become aware of such unconscious tendencies rooted in the base of the personality and it was a lot of work on my part to guide them through the process, but I did see that these people eventually became heterosexuals with healthy relationships.  This is a process much more refined than the \"Pray The Gay Away\" dogmas that harmed many people by making them more repressed and guilty about a homosexuality that never disappeared or was successfully transmuted into heterosexuality.  I saw that many people could become completely heterosexual by processing their complexes in the svadhistana, but not all.  <br><br>In short, I always tried to treat homosexuals as I do other people.  If they express sexual imbalances then I try not to see it as so different than heterosexual imbalances.  If they are more mature, conscious, and responsible I simply recommended monogamy and a mature, compassionate relationship just as I recommend to heterosexuals.  <br><br>Spiritual practice with yogic meditation depends so much upon understanding yoga psychology which also includes bio-psychology. Bio-psychology in this sense is understanding how the non material mind acts in synchronicity with the material body. It is not just the abstract understanding of how the mind connects with the glands and organs of the body but rather a practical understanding of this science with the end of bringing tranquility to the mind. In order to calm the mind it is necessary to confront one´s bio-psychological complexes, the unconscious drives and impulses that affect one´s peace of mind. Meditation is not an escape from these complexes. Meditation is the cure for all existential complexes. In the beginning of this process the mind is working more with biological desires and fundamental existential issues like self worth and establishing a positive self image by keeping the mind in a healthy and balanced state that is full of purpose and meaning. Without confronting the blind impulses one remains stuck in them and adjusts life according to their governance, which in the end is but “a raging bundle of desire in a dying animal.”<br><br>Instead of studying biology or endocrinology a yogi uses the mind to consciously reflect upon the body. Mental blockages also have bio-psychological “energetic” blocks which can be understood and also acted upon by the contemplative mind. According to yoga psychology the mind uses the brain as its seat and moves throughout the central nervous system. It has several nexus with the physical body in places where the nervous system branches out of the spinal column to control the glands and organs of the body. Traditionally, these centers have been called “chakras.” Yogis consider them whirling vortexes of subtle energy that the concentrated mind can perceive and feel and even influence with concentrated thinking and imagination. I prefer to call these centers “vortexes” because the word chakra now has so many flaky new age dogmas attached to it. I wrote “A Name To The Nameless” as an attempt to explain my understanding of these centers and how to develop the mind body system in the practice of yogic mediation.<br><br>Understanding sexuality is essential to peace of mind and spiritual development. Human psychological issues are rooted in our relationship with other people and we seek to have deeper relationships with other humans the more we grow and develop. Of course when there is a sexual element in these relationships they become all the more complex.<br><br>Modern biology has a developed understanding of how testosterone effects brain development. Not only is it responsible for sexual desires but it is also related to aggression. Yoga psychology recognizes this as well but also proposes that a properly balanced second “chakra” or “svadhistana” vortex (which corresponds to the genital organs) also helps one develop the foundations of self confidence and rationality. A balanced second vortex (svadhistana means self-establishment) expresses balanced sexuality and with self confidence and rationality established within the personality there is less need of the self defense mechanism of aggression. An imbalanced second chakra is fixated on sexuality with all kinds of psychological complexes propelling sexual behavior. Sometimes people use sex to cover insecurities or express aggression and domination while others are ignorant of other pleasures and indulge in sexuality as if it were the only true desire in life. The imbalanced second chakra is the root of machismo or toxic masculinity. Only humans who do the work of deep self reflection and take moral responsibility for their blind impulses can make any spiritual advancement. The reason why spirituality is so rare on the planet is because most people still have not resolved their fundamental sexual and self confidence issues.<br><br>I already wrote A Name To The Nameless as a theoretical structure. When I think of that old work I often relate those ideas with the life I have lived and the people whom I have met since then. A friend once suggested that I write a practical commentary for this theoretical work. Maybe this is the beginning of the endeavor?<br><br>Revisiting the second or “svadhistana” vortex reminds me of how I once met a follower of this healer, an educated young man who thought my neutered donkey who still chased around the lady donkeys might have miraculously grown a new pair. He had very high qualifications while he was in high school and so I thought he was joking but he actually believed it. I told him to examine the donkey and see if he could find the new pair. Obviously, he could not, but he said that perhaps some pieces of his testicles maintained within. I mockingly said that perhaps he originally really had three jewels and the veterinarian with his preconceived ideas only removed two and one actually remained to continue fueling those wild donkey desires. He said “maybe so.” Such was his desperation to affirm his belief in some transcendental reality where miracles are possible. He was an attractive young man with a lovable personality but he struggled to find a girl friend. I knew he had romantic longings but something inside of him either shut out or was afraid of expressing himself and his feelings toward women.<br><br>I always suspected that his issues were related with what Sigmund Freud called “castration anxiety,” the anxiety and fear of what will happen to him if he becomes vulnerable by letting this inner part of him out into some form of expression. Castration is symbolic of having your desires cut off from full expression by the fear of rejection. I think his fanciful ideas were fueled by his sexual repressions. Some people thought he was a closet case homosexual.  Some very potent and valid need inside of him needed to mature so as to liberate his mind from this tension so that his rationality could develop more completely so that the head and heart are equally balanced. His wild ideas only became more sound and grounded when he found a female companion years later. In the beginning of his awakening I could see an animal desire awakening within him and instead of being timid he became a little too cocky and assertive. The animal was reconciling itself with the human. Fortunately, love was governing his development and these expressions seemed to be just and adjustment to some newly awakened force within him.<br><br>People have so many wishes with biases and preconceived conceptions and seek to have them affirmed by outside sources, whether they are UFOs, conspiracy theories, or somebody who believes in X-File cases of miraculous donkey testicle regrowth. With irrationality the mind is desperately trying to impose some kind of meaningful order upon the inner chaos of uncertainty and self doubt. Anything that contradicts these biases are simply ignored. Sometimes they are laughable cases and seem innocent and harmless. But what happens when this fantasy bias is transferred into other aspects of existence, into one´s religious or political beliefs, motivating one to rally behind some politician, believe in conspiracy theories, or affirm a belief in some god and scriptures? This is where comedy becomes tragedy and where depth psychology is necessary as a tool to help humanity discover what forces actually guide our minds.<br><br>Is the same structure of irrational belief behind the casting of the vote or one´s attendance in church? The difference is just a difference in degree and not in kind. People from the Heaven´s Gate cult were all well educated computer programmers. They could perform complex logical cognitive activities by maintaining computer systems while at the same time follow a nut case guru that convinced them to castrate themselves and commit collective suicide before being beamed up into a passing comet! I suspect that even the most elaborate belief systems have something of this biased fantasy element to some degree or another and that only existential insecurity and a lack of confidence in oneself (a castrated confidence) maintain them. And for so long do we keep the flame of hope glowing through all of the scandals and contradictions that emerge from these bio-psychological projections. <br><br>Once there was a young woman with AIDS.  She was in the clinic for a few days and interacting with us.  She behaved like a perfect lady toward me.  Near her I felt really heavy and dirty inside my mind, like I had been living a totally different life than my own.  The young woman began to feel better and believed that I was helping her.  I personally had very little interaction with her but the healer told her that it was I who was indeed helping her.  Later, she was cured and began to change her life-style.  On other occasions there were other young women with emotional and sexual problems that affected their internal feminine organs.  It was very strange and interesting to see inside of their minds, to resonate with organs that I do not have.  Again, I felt a little heavy for a few days but these people always healed and changed their lives.  I hardly ever interacted with these people because the work was so heavy and I knew that they had a lot of gratitude and could project a lot of emotional transference toward me.  In the beginning the healer always said that I was doing the work of the guru and that I was even the incarnation of Quetzalcoatl!  Later, she would become jealous of people`s respect for me and I went from being Quetzalcoatl to Casanova, and instead of healing their internal organs she said I was actually manipulating their external feminine organs.  <br><br>There are many hidden powers along the path of mental-spiritual evolution, and also many hidden dangers.  Sometimes when a spiritual aspirant has a potent mind and an honest personality he or she is tested with a little occult power.  Because truth can be seen a little more clearly through a developed mind such a developed mind is given the capacity to see even more truth.  Perhaps they begin to see the future of people or see into the suffering of their minds and have the ability to even heal others.  Initially this endowment of mental force by the Macrocosm is for the sake of individual and collective evolution.  The more one advances on the spiritual path the more personal sacrifice is required.  Really, it is not sacrifice when there remains little selfish desire and one truly seeks the welfare of others.  However, no evolutionary process is entirely complete and one must always struggle to remove limitations.  If during the development of psychic powers there still remains some self-centred desire, then these powers may become a very dangerous obstacle and even a cause for spiritual downfall.<br><br>My friend got into trouble when she became a channeller.  Her information was always surprisingly accurate.  She could know secret details about the private lives of her patients.  Time and time again she was right on the mark.  I believe this worked for her when she was only channelling one strong microvita, or disencarnate spiritual force.  However, with time she began to channel other forces.  At the same time she became more famous and her ego became too powerful and imperious.  Gradually, she began to lose her power and her mental equilibrium, a form of psychic schizophrenia like a wizard trapped in a tower.  Fortunately, she lost her power before she entirely lost her mind.  It is a blessing that the Macrocosm takes occult power away from people when they misuse it.  <br><br>I began to learn about microvita, or discarnate spiritual force, while studying with Chidghananda in India.  In the process of healing one may connect with certain microvita in order to get information on how to heal another mind.  This information and spiritual force is useful in that the distorted mental patterns that create physical illness do not affect the healer.  This is not the same as channelling.  Channelling is when one opens one´s mind as a vehicle for discarnate force and one´s will is suspended while the will of the microvita takes temporary control of the mind and body.  Channelling is always a dangerous and inferior healing process that eventually creates mental imbalances.  A strong healer does not succumb to the \"possession\" of the spiritual force that helps in the process, nor does the strong healer succumb to the mental patterns that create illness in the mind of the one being healed.  Instead, a spiritual healer connects to the information and force of microvita to use it in the process of healing.  This proper use of spiritual force helps diminish the influence of the negative patterns of the mind being healed upon the mind of the healer.   <br><br>Spiritual healing and working with microvita is not so much different in principle than leadership in the mundane social world.  A leader must be open and receptive to his or her subordinates.  One must be understanding and take into account all opinions.  However, a leader must have the strength to make decisions based on a greater discernment and insight that, while being considerate to all opinions, must have the strength to decide and override divergent aims when the decisive moment arrives.  A weak leader may be too influenced by all of the voices one hears and cannot make clear decisions because one wants to please everybody and has no strong resolve.  Similarly, a weak healer may be overcome by the influences of the infirm mental patterns and may become ill while trying to transmute them.  The weak healer may also invoke a discarnate force or microvita to do the healing work through their own mind and body.  Ramakrishna made a very relevant analogy when referring to a weak guru as a small serpent trying to swallow a fish but cannot and both the serpent and the fish are stuck in a process of suffering.  The serpent cannot swallow and the fish remains squirming in its jaws.  A strong guru is one who can swallow it in one bite.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>A really evil person sent me a good vibration the other day. I did not realise that he had such a bad vibe when I first saw him smiling at me and nodding his head to say hello. People around here are generally very friendly and strangers often say hello to me. He had a friendly expression that I connected with just before I realised he looked like a narco paramilitary with a bald head, long beard and was covered in tattoos up to his neck. Maybe it is just his style, I thought. Then I saw he was towing a crashed Volvo. Then I knew he must be a narco because who else in this part of Mexico could have a Volvo? I have never seen a Volvo around here. Also, there never used to be any men around here that looked like that. Nowadays, they are more common. They do not always carry rifles but sometimes do.<br><br>Anyway, strange encounters….I just went on with my day. However, I began to have a terrible headache and felt some really evil energy enveloping me. It lasted into the night and I could not sleep. Apparently, there was not much to think about. I did not have any fear of this person or what he represented. It was truly remarkable that this person who had the mental energy of a killer could also have a friendly side. It was an interesting contradiction and an interesting encounter to tell my friends and family about, but not something that should be keeping me up at night.<br><br>When affected by strange energies that leave me sleepless I practice creative imagination, an exercise that I hope will activate the subconscious to touch and interpret these disturbing energies. If there is some insight then there is peace of mind. Comprehension helps to assimilate the meaning of why such an occurrence happened and what it means internally, in the psychic and spiritual dimensions. Such an event might seem random to the sensory-intellectual mind but may be something very significant if seen with intuition. An intuitive understanding of what has happened makes the mind straight as an arrow again and the headache disappears. I am not really meditating as i am lying down trying to sleep. I almost fall asleep but am interrupted by a quick and vivid dream image or an idea that flashes into my mind. It gives me a piece to the puzzle. I would rather fall asleep but I cannot and must play energetic detective and let the spirit work its mysteries out to the questioning mind. Therefore, I just lay awake waiting for intuition to fill in all of the gaps.<br><br>The last thoughts I had before sleeping were very meaningful and eventually helped me sleep. I remembered how recently I was invited to attend a child´s first communion ceremony in a local church. Like so many times in the past I scoffed at that old institution and recalled how I once said I would never step into a church but more often I would find really nice people and good vibes from Catholics. I just accepted it as a contradiction in life. This time was no different. News just broke out a few years ago about the Church´s murder of indigenous children in Canada that they had secretly buried. Tribal members were still waiting for an apology from the Pope. I do not know if they ever got it, but if they did it came far too late.<br><br>I once became friends with a Catholic Father in Chiapas. He wanted me to teach him meditation. He had a very open mind and a sincere heart. He was truly serving his community with a good Christian spirit. Yet he was very stressed because his clerical superior was the owner of a few brothels and had many political and narco connections. I understand that fathers confess to each other. He treated me as one of his own even though he knew I was not Catholic or even Christian. I heard his confession and then he slept. It was one of the craziest situations that I had ever heard of.<br><br>I went into the church with these ideas fresh in my mind. However, there was a good vibration and the people seemed sincere. The priest´s sermon was on Christian forgiveness. He mentioned the recent violence and the terror that people were living through with all of the conflicts of the narco wars. He said that we must pray for even the wicked and misguided people as well. He was very sincere and I thought that to really be able to do that one must really have a high degree of inner peace and living wisdom. Most people were probably too terrified to be able to send compassion to the terrible. One must truly have a source of peace and love to make such prayers. Once again I was struck by this great contradiction. “Está cabrón, esa situación. Siempre encontrando las obras del Cabrón Divino.”<br><br>And as I lie awake I finally get my answer. Who knows who that narco who nodded at me is? Was he forced into conscription by the cartel? Was he just desperate and poor and made a bad choice by voluntarily joining. His cartel was able to get the support from our community because they were keeping out a much more ruthless and violent cartel from entering here. They never bothered the common people but the other cartel started to extort all of the local businesses. The “good” cartel told the locals that if they supported them they would keep out the “bad” cartel. The community accepted a parasitic relationship with the lesser evil. Maybe this death soldier was just happy to be at peace in a place where he did not, at least for the time being, have to kill people and wanted a respite of harmony with the local community? Who knows. This is such a crazy planet with such crazy people. Maybe even god is crazy. Yet there is love and forgiveness and healing in the universe. Could even a narco be touched by this? Who is to judge if we all come from the same essence? The only way I can remain an optimist is because there is obviously a spark of the divine in the human conscience. Upright individuals are always better than corrupt institutions whether it is a narco who wants a little peace or a priest who is a true and sincere Christian yet remains in a Catholic cartel.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>A few years ago a Facebook friend who turned out to not be very friendly made some comments on some photos of me playing the flute in some indigenous community in Chiapas. She said that I played classical music that those people probably could not understand. I told her I played the music that I personally like, beautiful and contemplative melodies that I find very spiritual and that can be played on a solo instrument. I told her it was not like I was playing Schoenberg or Stockhausen or some abstract music in which you need some modern (perhaps warped) sense of aesthetics to appreciate. I often got into friendly debates with my musician friends who were into more modern currents of music. I would ask why even a mind uneducated in music can find a melody of Bach or Mozart very beautiful but who would have a melody of Stockhausen repeating itself in one´s mind? You would have to be either insane or very abstracted from natural aesthetics and caught up in abstract, 20th century concepts of art to find some kind of beauty in that music. That is an extreme example, of course. Yet many people who are educated and from the \"first world\" cannot follow a much more approachable work of Beethoven or Mozart without getting bored or sleepy.<br><br>When I first arrived to Jaltenango I used to go and meditate and play flute by the river in the afternoons. I had many friendly interactions while doing so. Children and adults would come up and say hello and say they liked the music and wanted to see my flute. Once there was a man who would bring me mangoes from his ranch near the river when he heard me playing by the river. He had several varieties of mangoes that he would bring me and I would return to share them with my friends. We became friends with a few conversations. One day he asked more about my past and so I also asked him where he was from. I knew that most of the people in this region came from indigenous communities in Chiapas after the government started some land distribution programs in the 1950s. Most people had lost their indigenous roots, spoke only Spanish, and had entered into mainstream, marginalised Mexican culture. I guessed from his age that he did not grow up in Jaltenango.<br><br>What he told me was unforgettable. He was from an indigenous community of Chiapas. At 13 years of age his family sold him to a rancher where he was abused and overworked. He remained a slave until he was 16, considered independent and old enough to be set free. He said he worked hard and was able to buy a piece of land and start a life. He had passed through alcoholism and seemed to have an existential insight of how his past traumas drove him toward alcoholism. A few years before this I heard an account that helped me begin to understand the existential situation of so many indigenous people. I was at the CIDECII, an indigenous cooperative university in San Cristobal. A Zapatista leader was speaking about this subject of modern slavery, of how families were so poor that they sold their children to ranchers. I gathered she had passed through such a situation. She seemed to be a very wise, strong and admirable maternal figure that many people trusted. She said that being mistreated, physically, and/or sexually abused was so common with indigenous children who were sold into slavery. It was so common that it has become a core issue in the collective story of modern indigenous people.<br><br>After hearing his story I put myself in his place and could easily imagine how easy it would be to get lost in some addiction as a way to cope with such overwhelming traumas. Recalling it is personally a great trauma but also a great joy. It makes me feel miserable about the human condition but also gives one hope that all things may be healed. What would I be like if I had passed through such traumas: a street fighter, a schizophrenic, heroin junkie or just an alcoholic? It was inconceivable. What was even more inconceivable is how warm and loving this man was despite his past difficulties. I have found this paradox in so many of my indigenous friends and have admired their strong hearts.</p>",

Recently, while travelling, a person was listening to me play by the beach.  She was very grateful and told me that she had been depressed and that the music made her feel better.  I was playing what I remembered from Satie's Gymnopedia.  I knew most of it by heart, but there were some parts I had forgotten.  I decided to memorise the piece.  In my yoga classes (which I plan to restart shortly) I like to play music spontaneously, but once in a while it's nice to play a serene piece by a great composer.  I decided to record this piece to see what it sounded like when I listened to it.  I used my heartbeat to keep the tempo.  It's a little faster than normal because I had a strong cup of yerba mate before recording.</p>\n<p><br><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-227830798/gymnopedia-i-satie?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing\">Gymnopedia </a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><br>A mystic seeks some higher, absolute and enduring truth and declares the world as something that must be transcended.  Suffering the loss of what is near and dear in the relative, ever-changing world propels more conscious beings to renounce blind attachments and fleeting desires to find something higher, or at least relate to what is relative and temporal in a more sensible and compassionate manner.  Reading the works of sages and mystics of East and West one finds two main and opposing views of the relative, created world.  Some see is as something to be renounced and never to look back upon while others see it as something to turn back to because it is redeemable and there is some deep meaning to be realised within it.  The former tend to be pessimistic philosophies and often remove one from any joy in existence.  <br><br>I have had a few friends on the spiritual path who, when they were suffering some great loss or frustrated desire, chose the nihilistic outlook even though they had some spiritual understanding.  \"Yes the spirit is real but this world is just suffering and there is no happiness here.\"   I recently told one such friend that he was denying the validity of the world but at the same time was making his demands upon god to fulfil his desires here.  When it does not work out and when god cannot be extolled, then god becomes some kind of wicked entity working against him.  I said that some god is not to blame for the frustration of relative desires that are already based in suffering and separateness.  A desperate being with some blind impulse wants to impose his desires on the world and when it does not work out there is even greater despair and god is to blame?  The mind alienated from Consciousness is so shrewd and powerful and manipulates in so many ways.  What else but chaos could possibly manifest when it is driven by blind, unconscious impulses?  Might it have been different is the desire was more conscious and if one checks to see if the Tao, or intelligent force behind the universe, is backing up such a desire.<br><br>The supreme consciousness is within us.  It is evolving through us.  Our lives are so much greater than we can possibly conceive.  Each life is the result of billions of years of evolution through so many forms of life- plant, reptile, animal- their DNA is within us and our DNA is simply stacked on top of theirs.  Where did this impulse come from and where is it going?  Humans gave a clearly reflected consciousness.  We can ask ourselves where our consciousness comes from, from where the notion of \"I exist\" has its origins.  Mystics of all times and places have realised the perennial philosophy of the union of the individual soul with the supreme soul.  There is no escape from human existence and the relative world.  Blind impulse only binds one toward suffering while attempting to escape the world also creates suffering and emptiness.  To find union with the infinite one must move with life and evolution and flow toward the One.  <br><br>I am on the side of optimism regarding the relative world.  Being here in time and space and on this planet at this point in time is important and it has a great purpose that is capable of being understood.  One can discover the laws of existence in the universe and walk in harmony with them.  Certainly there are desires that are a complete waste of time and only lead to degeneration (perhaps the majority of them in this materialistic time).  However, one´s truest desires are one what needs to evolve and eventually reach the spirit.  If spirit is behind life and evolution then spirit will take care of and fulfil such desires.  If one seeks a love that is to truly unify with others and make oneself more whole, then such a desire will be fulfilled by spirit because they are eventually for the realisation of the spirit.  The infinite unity of spirit can be expressed in the relative world by love and compassion towards all beings.  If one seeks a lower form of impulsive, selfish love and is frustrated and despairs, then that is actually a good thing. It was an impossible situation, anyway.  Hopefully, one can realise how suffering is a self-spun invention, let go and be led.  </p>",

After one begins to meditate sincerely and feel that life is deeply full of meaning one understands that life is a process of liberation from emotional and cognitive bondages.  The individual is ultimately responsible for everything that happens and one´s inner attitudes and conditions determine what occurs in life.  It is no longer possible to blame anybody or anything for our existential and spiritual state of being when one begins to understand the law of action and reaction.  Instead, one is responsible for all of one´s past actions and the future requital of those actions and resigns to this universal law.  Only then can there be freedom, freedom from the past and freedom to act in the future without the cloudy disturbances of past complexes and fears distorting actions that generate negative reactions.  All spiritual people I know from all walks of life are on the path of this realization, no matter what their philosophies.  True spirituality connects one to the essence of life and the underlying spiritual laws that govern human existence and people who are aligned with the essence of their lives will always discover deeper, universal laws.  

If this understanding of self responsibility is realized to be true after one becomes spiritually mature, does it not also mean that the law of action and reaction was also active before one was aware of it?  All of the past suffering, inner chaos and disorder in life is not happenstance, but reactions to our previous actions.  It is a terribly heavy idea.  We often think of people as victims that have been treated unfairly in an unjust world where there is no real sense of order and justice.  And when the idea is presented that people are responsible for their own suffering sounds very cruel, like conservatives and racists that feel no sense of responsibility for  bettering the lives of the less fortunate.  I do not say that the law of karma should make one passive and insensitive to the suffering of others because "they deserve it, karmically."  Rather, it is to note that while trying to help other people it is important to understand that a part of their being is deeply tied to their suffering and to try to liberate it is to entangle oneself with something much more complex than a difficult personal history or tragic social injustices that harm one and inhibit personal growth.  There is also the mental pattern that one carries into these situations, certain attitudes and charged mental forces that resonate with these individual and social circumstances.  Some self-destructive "a priori" mental pattern accompanies their lived experiences, pre-disposing them to some suffering in life.

Teaching meditation to me was always a great joy, although very difficult at times.  Some people just needed a little instruction and guidance and they advanced very well by their own discipline and inspiration.  The good results of just a little discipline  inspired them onward in their spiritual practice.  Having the perspective of remaining in the "witness" state of consciousness as they learned in meditation helped them understand the clashes that life would inevitably bring their way.  They could see the deeper meaning of a situation and the lesson to be learned because they were able to stay in a calm center and this state of calmness always guided one intuitionally through a situation.  And with each clash there is greater cohesion in the inner mind and an understanding of the laws of the mind and spirit.  Everybody gets stuck now and then but a good meditator usually finds the answers they need in their meditation but also by associating with like-minded people in a similar path.  We are all much more similar than different and people with a little more experience and time on the spiritual path can share their experiences with others to help guide them forward.  

Teaching people who are already in the process of "self-actualization" is all too easy.  They take on their own existential burdens.  However, not many people advance so easily.  Most carry more baggage and this is always more work for the teacher.  Many people need help and seek relief for their existential maladies, but not everybody is ready to go deeply into themselves via tantra yoga or other really strong approaches to meditation and spiritual discipline.  This is only possible by combining a lot of psychotherapy techniques along with the spiritual practices.  Some people may need something akin to therapy, others just need to talk and address their issues with a trusted guide, while some people just need to be inspired by some good ideas.  When one is in a spiritual society it is important that there is a culture of spirituality available to all with sufficient emotional and intellectual tools for the community.  

Unfortunately, this is where things become very difficult and where so many spiritual societies end up becoming religions or cults.  Instead of having effective techniques of spiritual practice there enter ideas of inclusiveness and privilege for those on the inside.  They follow behind some charismatic leader and instead of really doing their own inner work, they take refuge in the prestige of the teacher or their group.  They may learn the spiritual lingo and repeat it like parrots while trying to make an impression on newcomers.  Here, one simply develops the same prejudices in mundane social life that make the ego feel superior or empowered.  The underlying sense of inferiority is covered up by self aggrandizement but these complexes are never really transmuted.  Eventually all of these masks will fall and one is left even more lost and confused.  

Over 10 years ago the president of Ananda Marga Mexico was stabbed over 60 times in front of his home.  The ex-president was a millionare with a vast inheritance.  After his death both factions (the Hindis and the Bengalis) of Ananda Marga were fighting over his inheritance.  Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into the death of Gagan, the ex-president of A.M. Mexico, revealed that the fighting over his inheritance began just before his death.  There was a question of Gagan changing his will to leave his inheritance to his family instead of Ananda Marga.   He had no children but wanted to leave his assets to other members of his family.  Both sides began to accuse the other side of complicity in his murder.  Cirananda, the "Headkicker" monk who had a reputation for violence was who one side blamed.  Cirananda, of course, blamed the people on the other side.  When I was at El Misterio we all just sat back and said "how crazy, who wants to be a part of this."  Later we heard stories from sources outside of A.M. of how Cirananda was a menace in the neighborhood where he lived and was seen as a danger to women.  The general view at El Misterio was that Cirananda was a madman and a pervert.  It was also known that Gagan was a pedofile.  People on both sides of A.M. knew of this and his position as president was often debated.  Some people in the Ananda Marga VSS (Very Stupid Soldiers) said he should be taken out. Other people covered for him.  There were not many members in AM Mexico and Gagan was the only person with money.  If monks or nuns working in Mexico needed donations from Ananda Marga, then they had to be in well with Gagan.  He payed enough people off to remain president until his murder.

Most people whom I spoke to that were senior members of Ananda Marga believed the murder of Gagan was an inside job by the Ananda Marga VSS, the internal security services of the organization. If there were any doubt about A.M being complicit people often said that it may have been one of his pedophile victims. And it was not only within A.M. that people spoke about Gagan as a pedophile. He was a high profile elitist art dealer in Monterrey. People in the neighborhood saw how young, teenage boys were always entering Gagan´s apartment. 

Now I see photos of people of El Misterio with Cirananda, even dining together.  And not just El Misterio but the very same people whom Cirananda accused of murder are all dining at the same table!  The man who was accused of murder by Cirananda had said he had seen the mad monk roaming about with women in the local neighborhood.  He said that people had seen Cirananda making threatening sexual gestures  at women passing on the street.  The very same neighbors who knew of Gagan´s perversions were the same people who claimed Ciirananda made threatening sexual gestures toward women, like a gangsta rapper.  And even beyond the local neighbors in Monterrey, they also had a very bad reputation with the Monterrey police after Gagan´s death.  And beyond the local government Ananda Marga has a very negative reputation with the federal government as well.  All of their past crimes have them listed as a dangerous and undesirable organization.

Most people at El Misterio at the time thought it was likely.  I was not sure but he had tremendous violence and was very dogmatic like a Taliban.  Who knows what would happen if such violence shifted into his libido?  It was distrubing to think about.

But it is better to focus on the light side of things.  What resilience in our noble society of A.M. Mexico.  Now they can all sit together in the property and homes of the murdered pedofile leader and resolve their differences.  Now pedofiles, people accused of murder and public masturbation can all come and sit together at the same table.  With such a noble spirit of dharma you all can transcend all of the problems in A.M., maybe even unite the Hindis and the Bengalis!  I hope to see pictures of you all with the CobraKiller and the Bengali mafia soon.  Baba Nam Kevalam.

It was about 7 years before these events that El Misterio was formed, just after my encounter with Ramananda when he told us that Ananda Marga was failing in his objective.  He inspired to to create a separate and parallel movement to help ensure that the ideals of Ananda Marga would not be destroy along with the organization that Anandamurti had created to contain these ideals.  My encounter with Ramananda is something I wrote about more detail in an essay, <a href="https://williamenck.github.io/ramananda/">"Ramanananda."</a>  A group of friends later got together and bought some land in the Sierra Madre mountain desert in northern Mexico.  The place had a very high vibration very suited for deep meditation.  I always knew that a strong spiritual practice was necessary to maintain these ideals of Ananda Marga that I was commissioned to preserve.  All of our constructions were made of adobe.  They were simple but beautiful and it felt like they simply grew organically right out of the desert environmnent.

When I was fending off our ranch from the narco assassins I always meditated in this room.  I wrote about in <a href="https://williamenck.github.io/aghora-tantra">"Aghora Tantra"</a> of how I heard them outside of our property with a chainsaw one night.  I was meditating and I began to hear the OM sound so intensely that I could not hear the chainsaw.  I forgot all about it and went into a trance.  I came out of bliss in the middle of the night and remembered the chainsaw.  My head, arms and legs were all still intact!

I also used this space for the Ananda Marga revolution.  I wrote a letter denouncing the CobraKiller Shamitananda of attempted murder to the members of Ananda Marga in North America.  I knew I did the right thing.  I went and meditated, saw an infinite white light and 8 hours later I took a deep breath and came out of the trance.   I did not know 8 hours had passed until I checked the time.  I knew I had been in the breathless state of samadhi all of that time.

After those experiences and my writings about the narco war more people wanted to come into contact with me.  I was hermit who hardly left the desert.  I was working with associates who had more connection with the outside world.  However, one of them saw herself as my manager and was jealous of anybody who became close to me, people who became my students and friends.  Eventually she started telling me that a group of students who are doctors helping the rural communities of Chiapas were really a band of sexual perverts and basically behaved like a group of Roman senators in togas.  This was her effort to get me to despise them.  I found it hard to believe.  Later, she started to accuse me of perversions and saying I was trying to manipulate people sexually.  Yet at the same time she went around praising me and telling people I was doing the work of the guru.

There are many hidden powers along the path of mental-spiritual evolution, and also many hidden dangers.  Sometimes when a spiritual aspirant has a potent mind and an honest personality he or she is tested with a little occult power.  Because truth can be seen a little more clearly through a developed mind such a developed mind is given the capacity to see even more truth.  Perhaps they begin to see the future of people or see into the suffering of their minds and have the ability to even heal others.  Initially this endowment of mental force by the Macrocosm is for the sake of individual and collective evolution.  The more one advances on the spiritual path the more personal sacrifice is required.  Really, it is not sacrifice when there remains little selfish desire and one truly seeks the welfare of others.  However, no evolutionary process is entirely complete and one must always struggle to remove limitations.  If during the development of psychic powers there still remains some self-centred desire, then these powers may become a very dangerous obstacle and even a cause for spiritual downfall.

My friend became a channeller.  Her information was always surprisingly accurate.  She could know secret details about the private lives of her patients.  Time and time again she was right on the mark.  I believe this worked for her when she was only channelling one strong microvita, or disencarnate spiritual force.  However, with time she began to channel other forces.  At the same time she became more famous and her ego became too powerful and imperious.  Gradually, she began to lose her power and her mental equilibrium, a form of psychic schizophrenia like a wizard trapped in a tower.  Fortunately, she lost her power before she entirely lost her mind.  It is a blessing that the Macrocosm takes occult power away from people when they misuse it.  
  
Also, the situation with Ananda Marga started going down quickly.  All we encountered were criminal and sexual scandals.  She became enraged over this and often her rage carried over to me, and perhaps even all men.  I became all the more the playboy in her mind each time she heard of these monastic scandals.  Later, when we began to encounter homosexual scandals with the monks, she really lost control. She never expressed hatred toward gays before this but later started to see homosexuals around every corner, and eyed them with hatred.  Later, she even said I was a homosexual.

Due to this I was forced to try and understand something I had not given a lot of effort to understanding.  I also saw many homosexual expressions as something really imbalanced, however, I really did not see them as so much different than heterosexual hyper sexuality in the form of "free love" and open sexual relationships.  Whether heterosexual or homosexual these sexual indulgences always create more suffering than pleasure and cause degeneration.  Unlike her, I could not condemn them but I tried to see their higher consciousness beyond their impulses and distortions.  One must understand that our social world is degenerated with so much narcissism, hedonism, materialism and hyper sexuality that create so many psychological complexes.  Also, I saw that there were more mature and responsible homosexuals that contained their sexual expressions with other homosexuals in a more responsible manner.  How could I condemn them if these homosexuals were even more responsible than heterosexuals who practiced the hypocrisy of "free love" and went around harming others with their selfish impulses? Yet on the other hand I cannot assert, as some religious homosexual activist do, that God simply made them that way.  I think if God were to create  homosexuals or guide evolution creatively, then such a God would have given more appropriate organs for homosexual expressions, especially with male homosexuals who practice sodomy.  The anus is simply an excretory organ that is not divinely designed for healthy sexual activity.  I certainly believe that divine compassion is for all and that God does not judge anybody for anything, but that homosexuality just like other human mental adjustments and complexes are of our own making, our own history of karmic actions and reactions. God has nothing to do with the creation of homosexuality yet divine compassion can touch and transform all parts of our being. 

Also, some of her followers had certain homosexual confusions.  I saw them as heterosexuals with slight homosexual tendencies.  Intuitionally, I saw their minds had some strong complexes in the second chakra, the svadhistana.  I always saw that male homosexuals had two very strong propensities in the svadhistana:  lack of confidence and compulsion.  These emotional and energetic imbalances distort the svadhistana´s libido, cause the pranic or energetic flow of the mind to move downward (toward the first chakra), and overstimulate the first chakra by creating the confusion that the anus is an erogenous zone.  In the case of people with slight homosexual tendencies, they often resolved their homosexual tendencies by seeing these underlying complexes in their minds with the help of meditation, yoga exercises and the study of yogic bio psychology.  It certainly was not easy to become aware of such unconscious tendencies rooted in the base of the personality and it was a lot of work on my part to guide them through the process, but I did see that these people eventually became heterosexuals with healthy relationships.  This is a process much more refined than the "Pray The Gay Away" dogmas that harmed many people by making them more repressed and guilty about a homosexuality that never disappeared or was successfully transmuted into heterosexuality.  I saw that many people could become completely heterosexual by processing their complexes in the svadhistana, but not all.  

In short, I always tried to treat homosexuals as I do other people.  If they express sexual imbalances then I try not to see it as so different than heterosexual imbalances.  If they are more mature, conscious, and responsible I simply recommended monogamy and a mature, compassionate relationship just as I recommend to heterosexuals.  

Once there was a young woman with AIDS.  She was in the clinic for a few days and interacting with us.  She behaved like a perfect lady toward me.  I felt really heavy and dirty inside my mind, like I had been living a totally different life than my own.  The young woman began to feel better and believed that I was helping her.  I personally had very little interaction with her but the healer told her that it was I who was indeed helping her.  Later, she was cured and began to change her life-style.  On other occasions there were other young women with emotional and sexual problems that affected their internal feminine organs.  It was very strange and interesting to see inside of their minds, to resonate with organs that I do not have.  Again, I felt a little heavy for a few days but these people always healed and changed their lives.  I hardly ever interacted with these people because the work was so heavy and I knew that they had a lot of gratitude and could project a lot of emotional transference toward me.  In the beginning the healer always said that I was doing the  work of the guru and that I was even the incarnation of Quetzalcoatl!  Later, she would become jealous of people`s respect for me and I went from being Quetzalcoatl to Casanova, and instead of healing their internal organs she said I was actually manipulating their external feminine organs.  

All of these accusations against me were too much to bear.  She got the weaker members of our community together to take her side against me, including some of the people whom I had helped with their sexual confusions.  Nobody believed what she said about me but still some of them stood beside her.  Once, when I briefly left the place they burned my belongings.  I returned and did not know what had happened.  Later, I discovered.  I left and went with my students whom she had defamed.

Recently, their cult got together to have a "reinitiation" ceremony into Ananda Marga.  She told everybody Vishal was no longer a fit teacher and they all took initiation into Ananda Marga.  It was all because of their spite for Vishal and they were like a bunch of vampires dancing on his grave, in the house he had built and the spiritual vibration he had cultivated in that environment.  

Instead of taking offense at what they did to Vishal (Vishal was never truly me, it was my A.M. name which no longer exists) I try and see that it was really only the weak ones who took her side.  These people had deep personal problems and  came from histories of abuse.  I always thought Tantra Yoga was only for people who were already or almost "well adjusted" in life.  It was too strong of a practice for people with serious, fundamental complexes in their personalities.   Instead of being more rational, balanced and self-reliant, they really needed somebody to give them comfort and security and they took refuge in her just like the Ananda Marga members of North America took refuge in Shamitananda, the Cobra Killer.  I always wanted to avoid bringing people desperate to follow somebody or something into the circle because of my previous experiences in Ananda Marga.  I knew this could be what makes the difference between a cult and a spiritual society.  Yes, maybe the dark mother gave them her love, but she had to tell great lies about me and my friends in order to unite them.  

I can sympathize with her anger toward "machismo" within and without of A.M.  I did not like it either.  It provoked a lot of repulsion in me too.  Repulsion is a subtle tendency (at the Vishuddha level).  Essentially, it is a protection of one´s discernment (Viveka) and keeps harmful expressions away.  There may be moral grounds to feel repulsion toward immoral activities, yet one has to be careful not to fall into hatred.  Then, one´s heightened sense of morality can indeed become an expression of immorality if one begins to judge and slander other people.  Once hatred has taken hold of the mind then enters fear and paranoia.

To tell lies and continue to tell lies which defame innocent people is a pathological quality.  A sane person would desist and just drop the issue.  To continue with the false story requires too much mental distortion and complexity and the longer it continues the more imbalanced one becomes.    

This duality is also very pathological for the followers as well.  Nobody really believes her, yet they need her for their own security.  Not only do they support the lies and defamation of their leader, but they also are affected by the psychotic contradictions in the narrative.  As they are already vulnerable already such a mental position can bring no peace of mind.  Yet they have united with Ananda Marga Mexico, a swamp of cognitive dissonance.  Not only do they have to deal with the lies of their local cult leader but they also have to assimilate all of the lies, perversion and criminality of the crime family of Ananda Marga Mexico.  It is far better not even to begin with lies.  

There can be no unity based on lies and eventually these troubled people will realize they have all lied and have been lied to. What they have is based upon pure fiction.  I tried for sometime to cover for them with the hope that they would not fall too hard when they receive the reactions to their actions but it was a form of falsehood on my part.  Covering for people who hated and betrayed me, it made me feel so sick!  It is far better just to surrender them to the macrocosm and let the laws of the universe sort things out.

"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:
Petals on a wet, black bough."

After travelling through two international airports in one day I recall Pound´s "In A Station Of The Metro."  Sleepless, I lie awake at night seeing all of the faces of the day, even the one´s I never remembered even seeing pass by because I did not continue to think about them.  Yet I remember them at night, all at once in my room for a giant party.  

"We are one and I am always with you.  We see the Eminent in every face," the guru once told me.  More than a command of the guru it was a demand to perceive and conceive correctly.  To not see the infinite in the finite, the Macrocosm in the microcosm, is an error of perception for the microcosm.  Not seeing the divinity of another being is a spiritual shortcoming.  Recalling that experience makes me remember that we part of one great soul and I am not a lonely madman lying awake sleepless at night.  I was in a worldly hurry and did not perceive and conceive correctly.    Well, if this sleepless night is some sort of trip then let us make it the best.  I wish you all infinite love and now I will get some rest.

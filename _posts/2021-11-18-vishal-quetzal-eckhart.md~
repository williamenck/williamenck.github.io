When I started publishing my works, there were some problems with people who plagiarized them. Therefore, I copyrighted my books and essays. I also had to deal with a lot of cyber attacks when publishing on the internet and so I had my own domain and server.  I used elmisterio.org and williamenck.art.  Now I use williamquetzal.org.  
   
I still use the concept of Tantra Maya without my old pseudonym, Vishal Eckhart. Even while associating with Tantra Maya practitioners of the Mayan tradition, I always made it clear that for me that Tantra Maya was the practice and study of Tantra as a universal intuitive science, be it Indian, Tibetan or Mesoamerican Tantra. I used the Sanskrit definition of _maya_ instead of referring to the "mayan" culture. In Sanskrit, "maya" means the subtle enchantment with the deep being behind creation. The knowledge of "maya" from a spiritual perspective helps to overcome the illusion of separation that spiritual ignorance projects onto our concepts of being, which is in essence the living and vibrant macrocosm.

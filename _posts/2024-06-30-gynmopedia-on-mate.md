I play the solo quenacho flute to aid contemplation, to cure a headache and sometimes in my yoga classes during the relaxation. Recently, while traveling, a person was listening to me play by the beach.  She was very grateful and told me that she had been depressed and that the music made her feel better.  I was playing what I remembered from Satie's Gymnopedia.  I knew most of it by heart, but there were some parts I had forgotten.  I decided to memorize the piece.  In my yoga classes (which I plan to restart shortly) I like to play music spontaneously, but once in a while it's nice to play a serene piece by a great composer.  I decided to record this piece to see what it sounded like when I listened to it.  I used my heartbeat to keep the tempo.  It's a little faster than normal because I had a strong cup of yerba mate before recording.

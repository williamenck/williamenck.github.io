<p>When I started publishing my works, there were some problems with people who plagiarized them. Therefore, I copyrighted my books and essays. I also had to deal with a lot of cyber attacks when publishing on the internet and so I had my own domain and server.&nbsp; I used elmisterio.org and williamenck.art.&nbsp; Now I use williamquetzal.org..<br />&nbsp;<br />I still use the concept of Tantra Maya without my old pseudonym, Vishal Eckhart. Even while associating with Tantra Maya practitioners of the Mayan tradition, I always made it clear that for me that Tantra Maya was the practice and study of Tantra as a universal intuitive science, be it Indian, Tibetan or Mesoamerican Tantra. I used the Sanskrit definition of <i>maya</i> instead of referring to the "mayan" culture. In Sanskrit, "maya" means the subtle enchantment with the deep being behind creation. The knowledge of "maya" from a spiritual perspective helps to overcome the illusion of separation that spiritual ignorance projects onto our concepts of being, which is in essence the living and vibrant macrocosm.</p><p><a href="https://www.williamquetzal.org/what-is-tantra-maya/">What Is Tantra Maya?&nbsp;</a></p><a href="https://follow.it/william-quetzal?action=followPub"></a><p style="break-before: page; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always;"><span face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><b> </b></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p>

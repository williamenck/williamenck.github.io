<p><br /><br />This evening my soul poured out and into all things, <br />leaving this empty, lonely vessel, and was filled<br />with an infinite, ever-flowing stream.<br />My soul poured out, <br />reeling and roaring into everything.<br />Ceased of breath, I am; <br />empty of form in a diaphanous blue immensity,<br />in the gentle frolic of the evening wind,<br />in the warm smile of the setting sun, <br />condensed into flowing rivers and streams,<br />settled into earth and stone.<br /><br />Now a throb in this vessels breast<br />animates and enlivens, pours into and through<br />the vivacious pulses of all beings.<br />A marriage of sense to soul;<br />nothing thought, sought, gained or lost.<br />Darkness falls on fleeting pleasures<br />and world is shattered to bliss.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.williamquetzal.org/assets/English/books/A%20Name%20To%20The%20Nameless.pdf">Excerpt from A Name To The Nameless</a>&nbsp;</p><div class="e-content">            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  Svadhistana Vortex’s main function is to secure the emerging sense  of identity from the womb of unconsciousness and blind instinct, which  characterize the pre-conscious and pre-human mind at the Muladhara,  Sensory Mind. &nbsp;Once a secure base for the personality is established in a  balanced Svadhistana Vortex, &nbsp;the personality can begin to expand and  encounter new qualities and experiences. &nbsp;Here we see the continued  expansion of artha vrtti and the effort to expand the Conceptual Mind so  as to acquire a greater degree of meaningful psychological development.  &nbsp;The higher expressions of artha are unable to express themselves  completely in the Svadhistana due to the primary activity of maintaining  and securing the psychological grounding of the identity. Once there is  a stable emotional foundation the personality can flourish and expand.</p> <p>The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word artha is relief or  alleviation. &nbsp;It refers to the relief one gets after the struggle to  find the name of an object whose name is unknown. &nbsp;This unknowing  creates a tension in the mind that impels the mind to seek equilibrium  by finding the meaning of something in order to give classification to  that which is not understood. &nbsp;When the meaning or definition is found  there is a sense of relief as the mental equilibrium is restored. &nbsp;In  other words, artha is the willful endeavor of the intellect to acquire  form and meaning for both the self and its world, an activity not quite  possible for the second vortex due to its occupation with primary  self-establishment. &nbsp;The fundamental need at the Manipura Vortex the  need for novel, creative self-definition.  This need is directed toward  social and creative activities instead of being occupied with basic  emotional and existential security.</p> <p>The path toward self-definition begins to qualify the growth and  development of artha. &nbsp;The Aham intelligence of the personality  is  confronted with new challenges that force the mind to seek creative and  resourceful ways to face these challenges. &nbsp;Development is not though  contracted, defensive emotional instincts as with the Svadhistana. &nbsp;The  Manipura mind desires  qualities and has conceptual capacities beyond  the mundane Conceptual Mind and self.   &nbsp;In the 2nd vortex there is a  drive toward basic, psychological self-preservation, while with the  Manipura there is a vigorous outward, drive toward self-definition and  expansion. The second vortex utilizes the Conceptual Mind, while the  Manipura refines this basic conceptual power with the qualities of  creativity and innovation.   The Aham grows by internalizing and  digesting more and more of its desires for the objective, external  world. &nbsp;It is at this stage that the Aham begins to have more control  over the chitta as it attempts to manipulate and maneuver the external  world with its creative intellect. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this process the  personality  acquires more clarity of experience and with this knowledge is capable  of even further expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here it is important to mention the relationship between the vrttis  embedded in their respective vortexes and the layers of mind associated  with their respective vortexes. &nbsp;The expressions of the vrttis  correspond perfectly with the functions of the mind of that level. The  cognitive aspects of the vortexes can’t stand apart from the emotive  ones. &nbsp;A mind trying to establish itself in the world of the Conceptual  Mind needs stout emotive tendencies to hold it’s ground. &nbsp;And it is  quite necessary for a mind that reaches the  dynamic creative layer to  have powerful attractions and drives toward that realm. &nbsp;This  relationship between the propensities and the mental layers, or between  emotive and cognitive factors, is a constant relation on all mental  levels.</p> <p>The creative mental layer, or Atimanasa Kosa, is the level of mind  that perceives the emanation of form from the “luminous factor.”  The  luminous factor is an invisible form field, or “morphogenic field,” that  imposes a certain order and form on the material world.  Form is  something mental and spiritual that manifests physically.  All things  that exist have a subtle form field upholding their physical being.   Just as there is a unified field of “liquid” energy behind matter, there  is a “luminous” form field behind both the liquid and solid factors.   At the creative mental level the Aham itself is a form, with a ideal  form of a person embedded deep within.  The forms in the mind are  archetypes of creativity for the Aham that are guided by the Macrocosmic  Mind.  Recall that  Macrocosmic Mind has always guided the evolution of  the microcosmic mind.  It has guided the evolution of physical  instincts in the first vortex and the primal thought forms of the  Conceptual Mind at the second vortex.  The creative intellect begins to  perceive these archetypal, creative impulses and find ways to express  them in its person.  These forms resonate with the mind and guide it in a  particular cognitive and emotive direction.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this stage of mental  evolution, Aham is struggling to arise out of the mundane Conceptual  Mind  and trying to enlighten itself with a creative and conceptual  understanding of form. &nbsp;“Without vision a people perish,” states the  Bible.  The Manipura needs a deep vision and outlook to be fully  functioning, otherwise it is like a sick organ.  Only broad, universal  ideas keep the Creative  Mind out of trouble.  Any ideology or vision of  life that isn’t based on universal principles that promote universal  love will block the vigorous expansion of the Manipura.  By nature,  desire for expansion will always be egocentric, but it is possible for  the ego to be aware of this and try to convert selfishness into  selflessness.  Such is the path to human happiness.  Slowly, the  binding, impulsive remnants of animal life begin to be transmuted into  conscious awareness.  The  creative layer of the mind guides us to the  illumination of things once dark and obscure. &nbsp;</p> <p>When these fundamental needs of the Creative  Mind are not fulfilled,  then the emotive vrttis attempt to force and impose meaning and form  for the struggling, unfulfilled ego. &nbsp;The luminous, fiery element of the  Manipura gives this vortex its fiery, impassioned ability to  psychologically enlighten inner, conceptual forms.   The Manipura has  tremendous power and creativity but also tremendous capacity for  conflict and even destruction when the person hasn’t found their own  vision and instead seeks substitute gratification in mundane forms.   &nbsp;Manipura literally translates to the ‘city of jewels’.</p> <p>The creative Manipura mind is a whole new faculty for the evolving,  Conceptual Mind.  Gradually, the basic concepts of the Svadhistana  acquire more elaborate color and form at the Manipura.  A strong,  developed Manipura has learned and accomplished many things and  therefore has a little practical knowledge of existence and more  self-confidence and definition.  A less developed Manipura will be  frustrated, ambitious, fearful and feel compelled to follow the  superficial forms of social convention instead of one’s own creative,  innovative desires.  The consumptive and ambitious  tendencies of the   weak Manipura Vortex are concerned more with the attempt to acquire  externally rather than to actually realize the true meaning of  self. &nbsp;  This emerging personality in the Manipura blindly fixates on selfish  attachments and ambitions. &nbsp;Therefore, the outward and vigorous  development of the Manipura is not just expanding toward something  greater, but is  compensating for the psychological inferiority and  limitations of the Svadhistana. &nbsp;Here we see how the active and  passionate qualities of the Manipura Vortex compensate for the entropy,  dullness and lethargy of the Svadhistana. &nbsp;Due to the nature of these  drives the mind is driven more toward external form rather that inner,   spiritual symbols. It may grasp an intimation of infinity with the  understanding of subtle ideas but still projects its infinite desires  into the material world.  The propensities that distort the Manipura,  Creative  Mind must be purified by the  cognitive abilities of the  Creative  Mind for the Aham to develop. &nbsp;A balanced Manipura Vortex  gives one a vital and very refined Creative  Mind that can perceive  itself much deeper and resolve in a creative manner its limitations and  challenges. &nbsp;Such a person has a healthy passion for life, is active in  pursuing his/her desires, is in constant need for new and meaningful  experiences, and is incessantly working at self-improvement and  transformation.  Such a well-balanced person will naturally resonate  with positive, expansive thought forms and will have an authentic,  sincere vision of life.  The Manipura mind shines with brilliant gems.   If we go after a few particular gems, we lose site of the whole.  To  conceptually comprehend the great purpose of one’s existence and have  the confidence and heart to follow it is the greatest gift of the  Manipura, Creative  Mind.  This is not the realization of the Self as  Shiva, but rather the realization of the Aham’s particular purpose as a  human being in a human world.  It is a stage in the journey as only a  sturdy, confident ego can let go of its limitations and begin to peer  into the Infinite window within.</p> <h3 id="the-10-manipura-vortexes">The 10 Manipura Vortexes</h3> <ol><li>Shame</li></ol> <p>Shame bears a resemblance to the vrtti, lack of confidence, in the  second vortex. &nbsp;The difference between them is that with lack of  confidence there is a generalized, pervasive inferiority regarding one’s  fundamental self-concept.  Shame is a contraction of the expanding  Manipura personality due to a disruption in one’s self-image.  &nbsp;The  punitive and oppressive feeling of blame and the corresponding self  and/or social judgment of the ego being inferior, a failure, unworthy,  ill, base, sinful, etc. are due to activities and interactions of the  ego that have transgressed social forms or boundaries or have failed to  meet the expectations of the social environment. &nbsp;Shame is an ugly image  of all of the negative judgments and transgressions from others that  one has identified with.  They begin to overpower and convince the ego.   One’s very own Aham suffers the imposition of others but this affected  Aham continues imposing the same negative judgments upon itself with  shame as the result.  For example, most victims of racism must somehow  believe that he/she is inferior to actually feel shame.  An external  thought form has been internalized and painfully felt due to the  inability to deflect it and not accept it internally.  The Aham begins  to live by a negative form of another that imposes on the weak  self-image.  Shame is also generated internally by failing to meet one’s  own expectations. &nbsp;The Manipura mind lives by an image, whether one’s  own image or a socially imposed one. &nbsp;If one falls short or transgresses  one’s own values and beliefs, then the mind is no longer nourished and  inspired by the positive image.  There is a rift between the real self  and the ideal form of self.  Shame enters and one feels an emptiness,  lack of meaning and a distinct sense that one is ineffective in life. &nbsp;</p> <p>Shame, whether generated from within or without, is essentially the  failure of the ego’s activities to meet the demands of its ideal form or  pattern of behavior, its conscience. &nbsp;Initially conscience is an  imposed guiding pattern of behavior determined by external, social  forces, but as the ego develops conscience becomes more of a thought  form that guides the self towards  greater realization of its  potentialities in accordance with certain psychological and spiritual  ideals. &nbsp;Shame can be induced by a transgression of the personal,  subjective conscience as well.</p> <p>Shame functions in few positive ways.  It can be a compensatory  system of checks and balances for antisocial behavior or behavior that  goes against ones own ideals. &nbsp; The feeling of blame and transgression and their effect of inhibiting   the negative activities can actually keep one from persevering with such  harmful behavior.</p> <p>While shame can serve a positive purpose by keeping impulsive  behavior in check, most often it has a crippling effect on the  motivational powers. &nbsp;This is especially limiting when the social  conscience is very rigid, strict and punitive, thereby making it very  difficult for the individual to meet those imposing expectations. &nbsp;&nbsp;It  is the same with self-judgment within the individual as well. &nbsp;All too  often it is the rigid subjective conscience of the individual that  perpetuates its own sense of shame by setting up unreal expectations for  him/herself that can’t possibly be met. &nbsp;Whether induced from within or  without, they both lead to an entropy and contraction of the evolving  personality. &nbsp;</p> <p>Shame is often the great demon behind the monstrous face of a really  negative personality. &nbsp;When one feels unworthy and base, then the mind  will naturally gravitate toward what is low and base. &nbsp;Nobody wants to  feel the weakness of shame and to feel empowered one may use  manipulative and aggressive means that aren’t necessarily helpful. One  may resent the positive qualities of others because of their own sense  of inferiority and can become aggressive, competitive, invidious, and  hateful. &nbsp;Or perhaps narcissism and vanity will try to cover up one’s  self-disgust. &nbsp;Looking behind all of the masks of the negative aspects  of the ego the demon of shame projects and controls the negative  self-image.</p> <p>The shame complex, like any other complex, is resolved when one finds  a true form and meaning for the personality. &nbsp;Instead of feeling bad,  low, and unworthy, one must find a vital, creative and healthy  self-image to put one back on the path of balanced growth.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Slander</li></ol> <p>It has already been mentioned that the Manipura Vortex directs the  vigorous outward expansion of the mind. &nbsp;Here the will endeavors to  acquire a certain power and mastery over the objective world. &nbsp;When  there is some sort of frustration to this power drive the mind seeks a  way to overcome the obstruction in order to make the will stronger than  the impediment. &nbsp;Slander is the attempt to negate the fear, doubt, and  insecurity caused within the subject by the force (another person or  group of persons in most cases) that obstructs the connection of the  subjective will to the objective environment. &nbsp;This negation takes the  form of berating and belittling the self-created “enemy”  in an attempt  to psychologically weaken the impact that this enemy actually has on the  ego. &nbsp;In this process the fear evoked from others is distorted and  projected.  While the will is attempting to overpower the crippling  effect of the offending parties, the slandering ego feels that by  defaming another that they are actually negating and weakening them.</p> <p>With this tendency the mind is still very deeply entrenched in a very  marked and dualistic self/other dialogue. &nbsp;The slanderer derives a  mental momentum and empowerment from its slander by feeding off the  negation of the other. &nbsp;This negation functions as a defense mechanism  to keep the dynamism and power of the will and self-confidence intact.  However, the potential for positive expansion out of strife and conflict  with others  is hampered. &nbsp;The ego is basing itself upon a negation of  others. &nbsp;This cycle of conflict continues until the Creative  Mind seeks  refuge in a higher order of intelligence and insight. &nbsp;This perspective  isn’t reached until this marked dualism is overcome with  judicious  discernment at the Anahata level. &nbsp;It is not just this particular vrtti  of the Manipura that keeps one confined and bounded to the world of  external form. &nbsp;Rather, all of the vrttis of the Manipura with their  willful ego-oriented power drives are associated with a weak ego image. &nbsp;  An effort of will guided by a very positive idea is needed to overcome  these weaknesses and fears that cause conflict with other egos.</p> <ol><li>Jealousy</li></ol> <p>Jealousy is always related to shame.  Behind jealousy is the belief   that one’s own qualities, abilities, performance, etc. are inferior to  those of others.  &nbsp;If one were to simply notice the positive qualities  of others without thinking of them in the context of one’s own desires,  then there would simply be a recognition of another’s qualities and  abilities. &nbsp;But because the mind at this level of development is so  preoccupied with its own ambitious tendencies it makes a comparison to  itself.  Seeing oneself as lacking these desirous qualities,  one  desires them for oneself. &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of creating a novel self-image, the  weak Manipura Vortex with jealousy derives its significance by emulating  the image of another.</p> <p>This vrtti is related to and can induce so many other tendencies. &nbsp;In  many cases a latent lack of confidence (second vortex) affects the  thought processes in such a way that one’s thinking is always about what  one doesn’t have. &nbsp;It is this lack of self-worth that very often makes  one susceptible to jealousy. &nbsp;Jealousy affects and activates other  tendencies of the Manipura as well. &nbsp;Jealousy is so often responsible  for hatred, fear, and slander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the feeling of jealousy arises in  the mind it is all too easy to begin to passionately hate the adversary  that you’ve self-constructed, and who is there better to slander than  those you hate? &nbsp; And does not this negativity and sense of comparison  and competition with another induce even more fear as well? &nbsp;Perhaps you  won’t ever match up to the other. &nbsp;And perhaps an underlying sense of  fear was responsible for the jealousy in the first place.</p> <p>The jealous, invidious mind must find the strength to value and  respect its own qualities and process of growth. &nbsp;With jealousy one is  completely disregarding oneself as a creative process. &nbsp;The person is a  microcosm with a definite plan and purpose, evolving in the path toward  union with the Macrocosm. &nbsp;Within the person are all of the latent  qualities and forms of intelligence to help find a sense of dignity and  self-respect.</p> <p>4 and 5. Staticity and Melancholy</p> <p>When the will projection of the ego at the Manipura level is unable  to link itself to its environment and thereby sustain its psychological  economy, there is a devitalizing effect on the mind. &nbsp;The energy  accustomed to moving outward loses its objects of desire, its chain of  gratifying objects. &nbsp;Since the identity of the ego is so externalized on  objective forms outside of itself, the loss of this object of desire  and meaning (artha) for the ego is experienced as an actual loss of  self. The causes of this are numerous- excessive stress, illness, other  psychological issues disrupting balance and harmony in the mind,  existential crisis, to name a few. All of these occurrences that create a  rift in the economy between internal desire and external gratification,  can lead to the feeling of inertia and staticity. &nbsp;In this state the  mind lacks the vitality to seek its pleasure and happiness because of  this split. &nbsp;This is staticity.</p> <p>When this condition becomes more intensified or is prolonged  melancholy ensues. &nbsp;Melancholy can be likened to psychic stupor in the  2nd vortex as they both are generated from the ego’s inability to make a  link with its environment. &nbsp;While psychic stupor is a reaction to a  stressor that can uproot the entire psychological foundation, melancholy  is a more refined expression of this in that the devitalizing of the  mind is caused more by a loss of personal meaning. &nbsp;The mind at the  Manipura is more refined and complex than at the Svadhistana and  therefore the disruptance of the mind at that level is caused by the  mental associations at that level and also respond with a reaction based  on that level of cognitive and emotive functioning.</p> <p>Melancholy, according to Kristeva, &nbsp;is asymbolia- the loss of  meaningful symbols and forms that the personality has been attached to  in order to define and orient itself. &nbsp;The depression is due to the fact  that the ideas that have supported the personality are no longer  functioning in the same ways. &nbsp;There remains only a void.  This can be  caused by a disruption in the environment or social world or by a change  within the personality that makes it difficult to adjust in the  customary manner. In both ways is the personality is at a loss of how  and where to reorient itself to a meaningful identity. &nbsp;</p> <ol><li>Cruelty</li></ol> <p>As mentioned previously, the psycho-evolutionary step toward the  Manipura level of mind represents a much-heightened degree of  self-consciousness by means of a more refined Creative Mind and a drive  to expand it toward the external world. &nbsp;Here the psyche itself actually  begins to be a somewhat conscious object for the intellect. We saw that  in order to have shame, slander, jealousy, inertia, etc. it was  necessary to think of the ego and its qualities as &nbsp;reference for the  ego image. &nbsp;This concern is certainly present, however it is greatly  obscured by the other ego-centered, impulsive and impassioned tendencies  and therefore the pure and lucid contemplation of the personality is  not yet possible. &nbsp;However, it is quite an achievement for the mind to  be making an indefatigable though impulsive effort to overcome the  torpor of the Svadhistana.</p> <p>With the propensity of sadism there is a very thorough but mostly  unconscious recognition of the limitations of the ego along with a  feeling of self-hatred and disgust. &nbsp;One unconsciously sees all of the  limiting tendencies of the 2nd and 3rd vortexes and looks upon oneself  as a pitiful nonentity. &nbsp;Instead of consciously recognizing these  self-perceptions they are displaced and projected onto others who have  these same complexes. &nbsp;Therefore, the complex that is so unconsciously  despised within oneself is consciously recognized in another along with  all of the corresponding self-hatred. &nbsp;With this defense mechanism the  tension arising from self-disgust is directed toward another and that  other thereby becomes the scapegoat for one’s own shortcomings. &nbsp;Hence,  the old maxim that one really hates most what one sees in oneself.</p> <p>Sadism, this tendency to inflict harm upon another in order to  protect oneself, is expressed in various ways ranging from violent,  physical aggression to contemptuous remarks and teasing, to witch hunts  and Auschwitz. &nbsp;Like slander it is a defense mechanism that feeds off of  others in order to try to maintain a psychological equilibrium. &nbsp;It  bears a deep resemblance to resentment at the Svadhistana but is a  little more psychologically complex in that now the fiery Manipura  tendencies add even more fuel to the fire of hate.</p> <ol><li>Blind Attachment</li></ol> <p>The propensity of blind attachment serves the same function of  compulsion in the second vortex but at a higher stage of mental  development. Again we see how the propensities recapitulate themselves  in a higher, more consciously evolved form. At each successive stage of  development there is a variation and evolution on a psychological theme,  a variation in the protection, sustaining, and expanding tendencies of  mind in accordance with the increasingly refined and more conscious  stages of development.  This evolution of the mental structure arises  not just through clash and cohesion in the mind but also due to an  innate guiding faculty deeper within the mind.  Ultimately, the  all-attractive power of Consciousness leads all minds back into their  Supreme Subjectivity.</p> <p>Blind attachment gives an unquestionable and rigid sense of certainty  to the Aham. Here the ego has moved into newly acquired territory that  isn’t thoroughly mastered and controlled. The social world with all of  its complex ideas is a great challenge to the mind that was so  previously immersed in its more native, primal instincts. In order to  secure a niche in this more complex world of image and form without  confusion and self doubt as to whether one has the vigor and fortitude  to face the challenges of a higher order, the mind clings to either to  its previous achievement or the ideal modes of being that it sets for  itself.  The name and form of the ego or the ideals of the superego are  rigidly, even fanatically upheld. But why must this be blind attachment  instead of simply another lighter attachment.   It must be blind so as  to be unquestionable. The impulse is like a photon that after having  been released through fusion in the suns core bounces around in the body  of the star colliding with other forces until, after millions of years,  it finds its way to the surface where it is free to pursue its momentum  in a vaster space with less hindrance. The birth of consciousness must  move forward, never backward, and this blindness secures, at least for a  while, this forward momentum. Again, viewing this tendency from a  higher, calmer, discerning perspective makes it seem limiting, but blind  attachment certainly has its place for the insecure ego. However, as we  expand our creativity  and awareness it is necessary to overcome our  irrational insistence, demands, fanaticism, and manipulative tendencies  that blind attachment fosters.</p> <p>Although one may be blindly attached to another person or social  group for a sense of security, in the end one is always attached to  one’s own image. Our own sense of identity and worth is still determined  by being recognized by others. Blind attachment is not yet love,  because it seeks out of desperation and takes more than it gives.  However, everyone calls it “love.” A good friend of mine once said “What  is love but repressed hate?”</p> <p>Any image casts a shadow. Shame and fear and suffering are in this  shadow. And, in most cases, this image is sustained by a vague  expectation how you think others should see you. So much fuss over what  is not even your own! If one must hold to an image, then it must be as  light as possible. Truly, one is free to live by or create any image  possibly conceived by the mind. The problem is that any image created in  this microcosmic existence in time and space is that the finite image  always bounces up against the eternal flow of your immortal existence.  It is much better to flow with Tao, the cosmic moral order, than against  it. You can’t hide from your Self forever. At the base and essence,  behind fear and trembling, we know it is all just a story and that we  haven’t get began this new, inner life. The life of the separated ego  image is determined to receive reactions according to how one’s image  has shifted, metamorphosed, or distorted the natural flow of expanding  human consciousness. There really are inner laws of harmony which we  must learn not to transgress, but rather complement and further them.  The vain ego image, because of its very nature and place of inception,  will always suffer reactions and this shame will always bind one to the  concept of a limited and mortal identity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fearlessness is the only path to wholeness. The wise who see beyond  the limits of the Aham and into the Mahat are the only ones who could  play the game of the image correctly. Without escaping life, they move  right through it. The personal, spiritual self is but a name to the  nameless, an image given to you to help you function in this world so as  to eventually free yourself. “Time is a moving image of eternity” said  Plato. Only within this relation to the infinite, eternal, nameless  being, do we find our own true name and nature within time. Spontaneous,  natural and free, the inner, mental reflection of Self (your true  image) flows really well with life because one could never presume upon  it. Love and sincerity are much more real than any appearance to mask  suffering by putting on a fine show exhibiting limited qualities. Being  sustained and ensured by the Infinite, the realized soul puts fear and  worry aside and lets life be lived care-free, as a joyful channel for  the Infinite.</p> <ol><li>Ambition</li></ol> <p>Ambition is the continuous propulsion for the mind toward physical  and mental forms for the purpose of expanding its arena of activity and  understanding. The Sanskrit word for this vrtti, trishna, literally  means thirst. It is an insatiable thirst that underlies the ego’s desire  to be something greater.  Ambition is the focus of will on desired  goals and the unswerving dedication to realize them.   Like shame, it is  one of the few tendencies in the Manipura that can actually be growth  promoting, even when viewed from a higher level of psychological  development.   Ambition want to make what is outside inside, what is  ideal real as the Aham  acquires personal significance and social  recognition by these achievements. For ambition not to be a force that  consumes the Aham, it must be guided with a pure desire for growth and  expansion that is not rooted in forcefulness and aggression.  Ambition  is misplaced desire for expansion and purpose. One wants to build  castles in the world by worldly means and completely ignores the vast  potential of intelligence and meaning that is within. So often ambition  takes one contrary to this path which is finally a path to liberation  from suffering and delusion. Infinite desire is only satiated with an  infinite object of pleasure, which obviously doesn’t exist as a  possibility of experience for the human mind at the Manipura. Our  misplaced notion of infinite desire projected into the external world is  actually a projection of infinity from within. Only that which is  unstained and unmoved by any vibration is infinite, anything else is a  finite wave with a beginning and end. It is only deep within the  subjective witness of the mind that we find the ever-present Shiva. This  Supreme Subjectivity  is always present behind the mind and ever ready  to take the mind back to its source of awareness and bliss. The mind  must be prepared for this by following the path of dharma, or inner,  psycho-spiritual movement. This is so hard for the ambitious,  externalized, form-oriented Manipura consciousness to understand. It is  only when we find a true and meaningful purpose that takes us toward a  higher level of Self awareness that it begins to be possible to  contemplate the infinite within and live within its joy, its ananda. The  growth and understanding that helps substitute love and optimistic  expansion for selfish ambition and manipulation is how the person begins  to have a sacred reverence for his/her own existence and respect that  same sacredness in all.</p> <p>A friend of mine was once seated in front of Anandamurti. Anandamurti  was mentally scanning his Manipura Vortex calling out the propensities  one by one and saying “very good, no shame, slander,” and so on until he  mentioned “What is this, a little ambition?” He said that it was  alright and that it could stay because he was channelizing this vrtti  with a lot of social service activities inspired by higher propensities.  His lesson from this experience was that as long as their exists  external desires it is possible to channelize them toward something  really positive with the creative power of the Manipura Vortex guided by  noble intentions from the higher vrttis. This way, one fulfills the  wants of the propensity of ambition in the Manipura while at the same  time transmutes the selfishness of the desire into a more conscious  goodness that is shared with all. It is certainly not easy, but it is  really the only way out of the hell of selfishness and greed that  forever suffers a delusion of controlled and confined happiness. As  such, ambition converts into true expansion, a tendency in the Anahata  spiritual heart, and leads one toward unbounded yet tranquil happiness  in this world as well as the next.</p> <ol><li>Hatred</li></ol> <p>Hatred resembles very closely the propensities of slander and sadism.  The main difference between them, however, is that slander and sadism  are active aggressive expressions while hatred is more of a deep,  seething hostile feeling toward another that doesn’t necessarily have to  express itself overtly but may stimulate these other these vrttis as  well. It is a constant state of aggressive tension between the self and  the other. It justifies all sorts of negative expressions in the  personality toward another being that is constantly under one’s negative  evaluation. A little bit of hatred may be repressed or ignored or may  escape through passive-aggressive gestures or comments. Intense hatred  may lead to terrible altercations and even aggression. Very often hatred  is a constant and general attitude toward a world considered hostile or  unjust. Every situation or person that threatens the ego is hated.   Hatred is an armed assassin always ready to do some dirty work.</p> <p>In a poem of Byron it is written, “he knew not what to say so he  swore.” When the mind cannot assimilate a clash to the ego, the effect  of the situation remains unprocessed and all of this raw, unprocessed  mental tension remains inside, gnawing away. It is interesting to note  that the vrtti of hatred escapes outward from the center of the Manipura  Vortex directly towards the liver. Any form of hatred must be  understood creatively to catch its blindness. Very few people are  educated about emotional life. Normally, one learns how to manage  negative emotions only after they have become a serious problem that  requires major changes due to crisis.</p> <p>Hatred is a lack of the creative abilities of the Manipura. If the  higher, conscious parts of the personality are not vigilant, then hatred  as well as other negative propensities will worm their way in. Hatred  is so often one of the key culprits in the shadow of the personality. It  remains there because one doesn’t know where else to put it. One tries  to hide and suppress it, but it always finds a way out. Situations and  people that provoke negativity will always exist, we can only change how  we evaluate and react to them. One must learn to see the sequence of  events, external as well as internal, that led up to the feeling of  anger and reinterpret and channelize them in a different way. To begin  overcoming hatred it is necessary to re-envision one’s being in a more  harmonious manner that isn’t based on separation, fear, desperation and  conflict. Hatred cannot exist well where there is love and understanding  and all of the other mental alchemy that goes into the transcendent act  of forgiveness. Hatred is often a reaction to a prior, unconscious  interpretation of a difficult situation. This energy remains embedded in  the mind perhaps an entire lifetime. Perhaps one still remembers  insults from elementary school and while recalling them flushes crimson.  Or perhaps one is frequently involved in imaginary arguments with a  parent. And just imagine what happens if a real, present person moves  into this imaginary space of projection! This person will receive the  past hatred of the others history. The buried emotions that have  festered inside may be violently vomited out while the ego seeks to  resolve this issue by blaming another for its malcontent.</p> <ol><li>Fear</li></ol> <p>Fear is certainly the most prominent feeling that pervades human  life. Much that was said about fear of annihilation at the Svadhistana  Vortex is relevant to this vrtti in the 3rd vortex. Just as many of the  foundational tendencies of the 2nd vortex are translated and transmuted  into the expansive and vigorous tendencies of the 3rd,  fear a more  complex and conscious form of the pervasive fear of annihilation. Fear  is not necessarily terror in such an unconscious and pervasive sense,  but rather reaction to self doubt.  One doubts the  strength and ability  of oneself to uphold the psychological projections, activities, and  attachments that constitute the identity.</p> <p>At this stage of development the mind has a clear degree of  separation from the objective world (nature and culture) but instead of  being motivated toward true transcendence of relative and finite  bondages, it substitutes the potentially pure understanding and  conception of form and idea with a limited and egocentric version that  merely gratifies the ambitious and passionate appetites of the limited  and separate self sense. Because the will enforces itself through blind  attachment, craving, slander, etc., it is very unwilling (and yet  incapable) to let go of its egocentricity. Behind all of these instincts  for self expansion in the psychic and conceptual arena is the fear that  the link between the internal, subjective will and its definitive  external attachments will be severed. Fear is this perpetual concern  over the loss of self, at least a self defined by its cravings and  demands.</p> <p>Fear has many forms and many faces. At the most superficial level,  there is fear about the acceptance of the social mask, or persona. Once  we find a little more confidence, authenticity and individuality there  will still be the fear if this acquired image can be sustained. Even in  the highest degrees of development where one begins to have a notion of  dharma and the sacrifice of the individual will for the collective  welfare there will still be the fear that the lower propensities may  hinder.</p> <p>The Manipura level is the realm of the self and world that is defined  by an impulsive and egocentric will. It is not until the propensities  of the Anahata compensate for these limitations that the self begins to  intuit that the world and self are not held together only by its own  will, but is directed by a divine and moral order. The Manipura can  capture this idea.  This understanding is the only way to overcome the  fear of losing the grasping, craving and defensive separate self. The  only way for the Manipura to be strong and healthy is to serve a master  greater than itself. Only through knowing Brahma is there an end to  fear.</p> <p>Of course, the spiritual Warrior archetype is what manifests in the  Manipura mental level to guide one toward the spirituality in the  Anahata Vortex. Under this influence, which is a co-mingling of Manipura  with Anahata and Vishuddha propensities, the mind’s selfish desires get  transmuted into a greater effort to struggle to follow one’s  conscience. Any Warrior needs a master and the spiritual Warrior  archetype is so closely connected to the guru archetype. The Manipura  Vortex still can’t let go of images of itself, so it is no surprise that  the mind looks for an image or archetype for god. Instead of being lost  in the heroic ego trying to free itself from lower worldly bondages,  the mind seeks to understand a higher, internal meaning based on a  nobler idea than those based on selfish desire, blind attachment and  ambition.</p> <p>In the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, the 10-headed demon Ravana is a  symbol for the 10 propensities of the Manipura Vortex. The god Rama is  the hero who slays this demon. The Creative  Mind of the Manipura  can  grasp these ideals and put them into practice. The divine archetypes  descend upon the mind according to time, place, and person. Although  most people worship these internal ideas in the extroverted religious  sense, the developed Manipura mind understands the true significance of  these forms and that they have an archetypal, “guiding function” as Jung  termed it. It is this deep understanding of conceptual forms that gives  the creative, Manipura mind its genius.</p> <p>When I was a boy I was very curious as to whether Christ really  existed as a human being or was a deeper, more universal, spiritual  archetype embedded in the human conscience. This curiosity disappeared  as I began to meditate and understand that the divine grace is always  present behind the tranquil mind. I understood that the divine was in  the formless I-Witness of the mind. This is what yogis call the Atman.  Words and concepts and even the highest philosophy cannot trap the  infinite within their limits. What I longed for was this harmony and  union instead of a standardized conception of “god” which always seems  to go along with some kind of acceptance of religion, cult or tradition.  Although I had so many dreams of my teacher Anandamurti in which He  often told me very important things and even healed me, I could never  allow my mind to get locked into concepts like “guru.” Perhaps I could  accept this authority on the inside, but when people started speaking of  “guru” in the social context, it was so often based on other people’s  conceptions of what the guru is and not so much their own experience and  deep realization. This is true in any form of spirituality: the masses  follow set standards and concepts and don’t put much energy into  realization. However, it was in the height of my realizations of the  formlessness of the divine that I had so many experiences of divine  forms! Anandamurti, in dreams or meditation, always guided me toward the  formless, actual presence of the Atman and never said anything like “I  am the only way.” These experiences always revealed what i saw as deep  universal truths. My mind had connected with this particular form that  revealed truths so far beyond form. There even once appeared to my  physical eyes the luminous form of Christ after a deep meditation. I had  no doubt there was a divine presence manifesting as a form. His form  was translucent and the jade serpent that i had seen in my first  kundalini experiences was seen just behind his eyes at the level of the  mid-brain. I clearly understood that it was a symbol of the union of  heaven and earth and of god and humankind. The “serpent power” of the  kundalini, the divine energy latent in the base of the spine, awakens  into the brain and transforms us into something inconceivable for the  Aham. This serpent at the mid-brain was completely tamed and within the  beauty of the totality of the beautiful head of the Christ figure. I  thought of how such an enlightened brain must have incorporated the  so-called reptilian and mammalian brains into the mystical, yet to be  realized potentials of the human neocortex that has evolved above and  around them. Christ is a symbol of this yogic perfection, at least in my  experience. The vision was more beautiful and meaningful than anything I  ever saw in the Louvre or any other museum in the world. When I recall  it I return to that state of ecstasy in the present. As time goes on I  understand this as well as so many other visions of true form as deep  spiritual truths that one cannot normally grasp without the help of the  medium of form.</p><p><a href="https://www.williamquetzal.org/assets/English/books/A%20Name%20To%20The%20Nameless.pdf">Excerpt from A Name To The Nameless</a> <br /></p></div>

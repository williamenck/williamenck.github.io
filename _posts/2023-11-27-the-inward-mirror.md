I had just gotten off of the train in Berlin.  I was waiting for a friend who had been talking to two German girls and was exchanging addresses with them.  While waiting for him a punk with a blue mohawk approaches me and asks if I had a cigarette.  I did not understand German but understood his gesture.  I said "no" in English and he understood I was not German.  He asked me in perfect English where I was from and we started chatting.  Although he looked a little coarse he was actually a really friendly and intelligent person.  He asked me if I liked punk rock.  I said I knew very little of it but my uncle gave me a Sex Pistols cassette a few years ago when I was sixteen and I really enjoyed it.  It was not really music that moved my soul or was beautiful but the Sex Pistols were very humorous in their audacity and rebellion.  He started to sing some lines from "God Save The Queen". ......"God save The Queen.....the fascist regime.....they made you a moron.....and there is no future for you in England's dreaming.....". And then started to shout the refrain "no future, no future for you" at the people passing by.  Although a little embarrassed I found it humourous.  
I remarked that his English was so good because he listened to English punk music.  He said that God Save The Queen was a great manifesto for him.  Punks did not really  hate people, just their false institutions created by false pretty and princely people who screw everybody else.  He was sincere and well spoken and I liked his perspective but my friend came and interrupted our conversation.  

I had been travelling with this friend from high school.  He was a spooled rich kid who had been acting like the classic " ugly American" all throughout our tour of the continent after our high school graduation.  I think he felt inferior being in foreign countries with more culture than our shallow, suburban and corporate US culture and had to act superior to everyone to compensate for his inferiority complex.

My friend asked why I was talking to such a fellow.  I said that he was insightful and joked about how punk rock unites humanity.  My friend scoffed.  I said that at least instead of hating his brothers across the English Channel he was united with other punks who hated elitism and the wars that king's, priests and politicians have always created.  It was perfect irony, his coarse attitude coupled with an inward sensitivity.  I said that if I would have been in my grandfather's reality in the 1940s as an American in Germany then the punk and I would have been shooting at each other. "God damn Nazis," he said with a scornful laugh.  "You did not think the girls on the train were god damned Nazis," I responded.

Later that night after getting settled in our hotel and dining we were out walking.  There was some loud dance music and a line if people outside what seemed to be a club.  They were all stylish people, a little older than us, most in their twenties or thirties.  My friend wanted to go check it out.  I was not interested and said that I was dressed in a wind breaker while all of the people they were all decked out in really cool clothes.  The jacket I used was actually my friend's.  He was wearing a nice and even stylish coat of mine and asked me to trade coats with him for the night.  He insisted we try and get in and dragged me over.  He asked some other people around our age what the place was.  They said it was one of the coolest places in town and had been waiting an hour to get in.  My friend asked why it took so long and the young German explained that there were two way mirrors in which the staff there could see who was waiting outside.  If they thought people were cool enough they would open the doors and point at specific people and tell them to come in.  

I nudged my friend and said this was all so stupid, that there was no way that I would ever get in there even if I wanted to.  He insisted that we try.  

A few minutes later some really elitist looking man dressed in an all black suit opens the door and points at me to enter the club.  I was surprised and laughed to my friend.  I asked the guy in the door if my friend could enter with me.  He scanned him critically from head to toe and nodded his head in a negating, arrogant manner.  I said thanks anyway but I won't go in without my friend and walked away.  The guy at the door told the rest of the thirty or forty people that nobody else could enter and that they should get going.
My friend tried to laugh it off but I was afraid he felt rejected.  Nowadays I would say it was definitely a good think to have false dreams rudely broken so as to wake up and get real but at that time I still did not have such clarity and confidence and felt bad for my friend.  I felt ashamed.  I  was not sure why at the time but felt that it was all such an ugly experience; all of those sycophants who bend like a willow trying to get accepted by such an ignorant and superficial elite.  Who put them in charge?  Why do they decide things?  I recalled the punk I met earlier and reflected on how he was much more real than the rest of the people I met that day.  

So I told my friend that we should go back to the train station and find my punk friend.  He could bring his buddies and we could smash some beer bottles outside the club and paint some vulgar insults a on the two way mirrors.  At least my friend laughed a little.

Exclusivity is so destructive, especially when groups of powerful people prop themselves up by putting down others.  Although the people in the club were so frivolous and superficial, their attitude is found in so many exclusive circles.  If one is shrewd then other shrewd people invite you into their circles where one eventually risks getting devours by them when you are no longer useful.  It is the same with intellectual and artistic pride as well.  I have known some humble and even-minded artists and intellectuals but many artists are full of vanity and driven my ambition and a sense of superiority.   I even think that most spirituality is just rude vanity masked by tranquility and sham humility.  They will also use their two way mirrors and invite you into their circles only to eventually devour you when you try to be yourself.

Whatever one does one must be sincere.  To be sincere is to be humble.  Humility is not weakness.  It is a strenght acquired through so man struggles to put the fearful and isolated ego aside and permit the consciousness of the universe to work inside oneself and bestow some of its array infinite qualities into your personal expression.  This process is part of our inward evolution and all beings will eventually have to tread this path of integrity.  The Atman is the only true and honest mirror that we have.  It does not judge nor distort our true, inner image.  Perhaps it is difficult to see in this light of truth for a mind accustomed to darkness, but its process of integrating the wayward mind towards Consciousness is always for our welfare.  

Such vain and self serving attitudes are everywhere and are the roots of racism, classism, nationalism and all of the other "isms" that I find so shallow and stupid.  Human societies are mostly just silly popularity circles run by little princess and princesses who are so lost and lonely that they bandy together with other lost souls who think they have some superior qualities they can suppress others with.  The shrewd elite are really weak and fearful people who can never look into their inner mirror and walk a path of integrity.  I recall the Sex Pistols and the German punk reciting them:  "They made you a moron".. and "there is no future for you"......  

Truly there is no future for a humanity dominated by such ideas and our arrogance is destroying the entire planet.  Vanity and exclusivity are behind racism, economic and class exploitation and so many materialistic distortions that are destroying nature and humanity.  These are very disturbing realities that unquiet the minds of most thoughtful people I know.  I think that they would despair if they were not sincerely trying to help others and create a better world.  Yet sometimes the most optimistic minds are overwhelmed. Perhaps as an escape for myself I conjure the memory of the punk shouting the refrain "no future for you..." as  the rude lyrics of  God Save The Queen resound in the mind as a mantra to drown out these far ruder impressions.

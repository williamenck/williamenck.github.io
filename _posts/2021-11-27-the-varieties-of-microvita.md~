title: The Varieties Of Microvita
---
Anandamurti spoke of Microvita in several different aspects. He described the
grossest forms of Microvita involved in the materialization and manipulation of
material forces as well as the most subtle forms of microvita that function on the
psycho-spiritual planes of being. The focus of this work will principally be on the
function of microvita in the psycho-physical, psychic and psycho-spiritual planes
of mind. Because microvita is such a broad, generalized term that includes so
many types of disembodied microcosmic minds, I will refer to the entities
hitherto discussed that relate to human psycho-physicaI, psychic, and psycho-
spiritual planes of mind as mentities, or mental entities. I admit that my
knowledge of these subtle entities on these levels is still elementary, but I have
yet to investigate the function of microvita on the physical level, therefore I am
even less capable of attempting to discuss them.

Any attempt to explain Microvita without a theoretical and metaphysical
background would be like attempting to explain quantum physics to an 6th-grade
science class. Not only does one need an astute intellectual framework to
attempt to understand Microvita, but more importantly one needs to cultivate the
intuitive faculties through meditation. In fact, a highly developed intuition
bypasses the need of a highly developed intellectual, conceptual mind. More
often than not intellectual thought is a limitation to intuitive knowledge and
keeps one bound in circumscribed boundaries. Intellectual concepts are a
concretized and cruder manifestation of intuitive thoughts (recall the difference
between the sensory intellectual mind and the 3 layers of the Macrocosmic Mind
in the introduction). However, because intellectual thoughts do participate in
and mimic the purer sources of conceptualization that have their seat or bearing
in the Macrocosmic Mind, it is possible to cultivate these grosser thoughts so
that they evolve into purer, intuitive concepts. This is possible if we understand
that the sensory-intellectual mind is not an end-in-itself, but is merely a vehicle
for higher forms of conceptualization. Philosophers through the centuries have
emphasized the grandeur of intellect, although few have followed the intellect to
its fullest potential: intuition. In Tantra, intellectual concepts or models
(pratima in Sanskrit), are used in order to help the mind to obtain an initial grasp
of a spiritual concept. True, the concept originates in the sensory-intellectual
mind (Manomaya Kosa) but has the capacity to evolve conceptually into purer
intuitions as the mind ascends through the higher Kosas. This is in fact the
nature of the evolution of mind: that our minds contain germs of thought that
can indeed sprout into the most sublime spiritual realizations.

An aspirant begins his/her practice with just a germ of knowledge from the
initiation into their practice of meditation, but can transform that very fragment
of knowledge into pure spirituality. And not only is it a thought that grows, but
the mind as well. The nature of the mind is dependent on what it thinks. Subtle
thoughts can only be thought by a subtle mind. The only way to comprehend subtlety 
is to become subtlety. It is due to this that Tantra is a holistic spiritual practice 
instead of an academic philosophy.
 
So it is through this understanding that Microvita can be understood: that
thoughts have their origin in higher realities. In order to comprehend Microvita
and their relation to manifested reality, whether in the mind or in objective
being, we must begin to look behind the surface of things. We must see behind
the mere manifestation of a thought, an emotion, or any state of mind and realize
that there are "gods" or higher spiritual realities dwelling within all things.
Anandamurti stated that Microvita can be understood through the reflection
upon concepts. It is this reflection that supplies the knowledge necessary for the
mind to resonate at a higher level. When we reflect upon something, a physical
object, a thought, a feeling, we are conscious of the mental processes involved in
our perceptions and conceptions. Reality isn't something just ready made and
taken as-is. Instead, we investigate the processes, the sensations, perceptions,
thoughts, feelings, and intuitions that go into producing a state of awareness.
Within this sensitivity and heightened consciousness it is possible to see more
and more of the hidden, hitherto unobserved mental processes. Due to this, we
begin to see more. A new perception of a hidden mental process induces us to
ask more questions about the nature of the mind. We now know that there are
other aspects, other hidden processes and laws that govern our thought and
feeling and perception. Therefore, one begins to reflect upon them. From
there, even more hidden processes are seen and thus continues the expansion of
awareness.

If we begin to study and reflect upon the thoughts and experiences of minds that
have already traversed the spiritual path we can have an intimation of the laws
of mind and states of consciousness just above us. Imagine a mind attempting to
grasp a spiritual law. He or she interacts with a teacher that understands their
process and can provide clues as to how to arrive at a realization. This "outside"
impetus bears such a close relation to the actual mental processes within the
aspirant that it serves as a vehicle for fostering a leap in awareness. This is not
only the value of the company of wise souls, but the value of the study of sound
spiritual philosophy and psychology as well. A spiritual philosophy, if it is a true
philosophy of Spirit, should be a reflection and description of actual
psychological and spiritual processes of the mind. In other words, it is a
practical philosophy that relates not just to abstract and abstruse realities, but to
the very essence of the mind.

We understand mentities, or any other spiritual matter, simply by understanding
ourselves. The more refined our self-awareness, the more we see the spiritual
forces present in the mind. When Anandamurti described the 7 principal types
of microvita (mentities) their descriptions where very much related to human
psychology and spirituality, or rather, were described as causal agents in the
effect of human psychological and spiritual life. Take for example someone
struggling to comprehend the source of their resentment. They may see how
their resentment has led them to mistrust other and therefore remain isolated
and fearful. This person is aware of how an initial trauma, the source of the
resentment, has structured one's life in such a defensive manner. Through
his/her growth process one has been able to get in touch with the source of these
buried feelings and transform them to a great extent. Even his/her behavior,
attitudes, and lifestyle begin to manifest this shift toward a healthy awareness.
However, the tendency still clings and holds on to this mind. This person may
notice after a good amount of spiritual practice that the source of this feeling is
like a personality in itself. It is like an entity dwelling and inhabiting their minds.
It has served like a guardian, protecting and defending the mind from real or
imagined dangers.

Each of the 50 propensities are as such. They are like minds of their own. For
example, this person may now normally be calm and reflective. However, when
this propensity is set off some inner or outer stimuli, it is as if the dominant
personality is backstage. The intensity of anger or fear is something that may
take possession of the mind, making the person seem like there is some other
force inhabiting the mind.

One experiences this state of "posession" mostly in very strong negative
emotions, but also in very exalted moments of spiritual insight or creativity as
well. What true artist or other creative person has never felt the invisible muse
behind their thoughts and feelings, spontaneously guiding them toward the
fruition of creation? When exalted spiritually, it is if an angel or god itself is
inhabiting us.

Each of the 50 propensities has a controlling force or deity that regulates their
intelligent expressions. It is not to say that the propensities are separate
entities, independent of the inhabited mind. Rather, they are functionaries and
mediators for the expression of mind. Every mind has legions of entities-
helpers and hinderers, angels and devils- hidden but ever-active behind all of our
thoughts and feelings and actions. The mental personality is but a vehicle for so
many camouflaged and concealed expressions of mental energies to declare
themselves into incarnation.

Inherent in the idea of mentities is the notion of reincarnation. Mentities are
entities that instead of either attaining spiritual liberation (moksa) or undergoing
the normal process of dormancy between lives while waiting to be reborn in a
new body, continue to actively exist in the astral state between lives. Ordinarily
a mind cannot express itself between lifetimes. A mind disconnected from the
physical body, in most cases, cannot generate its own vital energy or prana
without the body to generate this energy necessary for mental functioning.
Therefore, minds in the astral realm, or the collective mind, waiting for rebirth
are simply dormant, waiting to be reborn in a time and place that allows them to
express their pending samskaras, or latent reactions to previous actions.
Previous forms of mental conditioning become conditions for the next
incarnation where the mind continues its same mental life from where it had
abated with physical death.However, there are certain minds with sufficient 
self-consciousness and mental vitality that enable them to continue functioning
in the after-death state. These minds, due to their level of development, are able 
to generate the vital energy necessary for mental activity without the necessity of 
a physical body and cerebral cortex to act as its medium.

The average mind depends on the sensory, motor, and grosser cognitive organs
in the cerebrum for its activity (the sensory and sensory-intellectual minds).
However, minds that have learned in their lifetimes to transcend the grosser
levels of thought connected to the physical plane and the physical body and brain
have attained a level of thought purely mental. They attained a level of thought
in the collective layers of mind in the Creative, Intuitive, and Causal levels, and
therefore their level of cognition is already on the same level as the mind in the
after-death state. A mind accustomed to this level of mental activity is a being
highly evolved in spiritual evolution and has already realized that there are levels
of being far beyond the mere physical and intellectual levels. Beings such as
these must have been, in their lifetimes, persons who had undertaken some form
of spiritual practice or virtuous living to develop their mental and spiritual
faculties. It is through morality and spiritual practice or meditation that the
mind is purified of its physical limitations and begins to realize the purity of its
spiritual essence.

On the path to self-realization, new mental faculties are awakened. New forms
of intelligence, more refined levels of feeling and intuition, and even occult
faculties are developed in the mind. If a mind becomes attached to one of these
faculties along the way instead of devoting all of ones potential to the realization
of Brahma, then such a mind becomes "locked" into a certain faculty. Instead of
realizing Brahma, these minds, due to their samskaras, or reactive momentum to
their previous actions, are locked into these faculties instead of being liberated
from all finite mental fetters. Therefore, after death they continue their mental
activity in accordance with their accumulated samskaras.

The Mind of Brahma generates, operates, and dissolves all created being. As the
Dissolver, it is its responsibility to dissolve all created being back into its infinite
essence of pure consciousness. Over millions and millions of lifetimes beings
work out their limitations of karma and samskara with the ultimate aim of
attaining their liberation through their union with the Infinite. A microvita, like
any other being, is a being existing at a certain vibrational frequency on a
particular mental level, attempting to work out its samskaras. In the after-death
state all of their mental potential moves toward their major bondages. In order
to work out their bondages they must exhaust their respective samskaras via
spiritual purification.

In their lifetimes, their egos were connected to their faculties (yatimana,
vashikara, etc.) Perhaps their heightened intelligence or spiritual qualities were
a self servicing vehicle of pride, vanity, or attachment for this otherwise noble
soul. In order to work out their egocentric limitations, they must use their
faculties to serve the creation in the after death state. This type of purgation
serves the purpose of unifying their minds with the Macrocosm by transcending
the egocentric identification with their abilities. Instead of attaining liberation
after death, they fuse with the essence of their mental faculty and work therein
until their pending samskaras are exhausted.

Recall that the root of all mental faculties is in the Macrocosmic Mind. The
higher kosas contain the blueprint or hidden order of the manifested, lower
worlds. When a subtle being- a being that has developed the ability to act and
intuit the higher kosas in their embodied lives- dies, he or she carry their mental
and spiritual faculties into an active, disembodied state of existence. From this
state of existence these beings continue their activities in order to purify the
limitations that kept them bound to their particular identity with a special ability
or faculty. However, these beings are more subtle after the separation from the
physical body and the bondage of a physical world and can therefore apprehend
their very own talents and genius even more clearly than they did in embodied
life. While living, there was still the weight and density of the physical world
that partially obstructed their full development. Now, in an disembodied state,
all of their refined, particular microcosmic intelligence merges with its source
and essence in the Macrocosmic Mind. These entities, in fact, merge with this
particular Macrocosmic function in that they actually become like "gods" in that
they are entities that must govern a particular position or station in the dynamics
of the mind of God. Brahma is purely transcendent in its purest essence; its
mind is involved in Generation, Operation, and Dissolution, but the actual
carrying out of activities is left to subordinate beings who have evolved and
manifested a portion of the entirety of Macrocosmic Consciousness. These are
the so-called Mentities.

In order to understand what a mentity is, how they "live" and function, and how
their functions effect embodied beings, I will give a brief overview of the 7 types
of mentity microvita described by Anandamurti. Later, I will go a little more
deeply into the metaphysics and occult causality.

The first type of mentity microvita described by Anandamurti is termed the
yaksa. A yaksa is the crudest type of positive mentity. They are beings that
while living in the physical world were very adept in using material resources for
a positive cause. They were very good people with noble intentions and the
welfare of others in mind. They accumulated resources like money and goods in
order to help other people. Rather than being an ordinary charitable person, the
yaksa personality had a characteristic genius regarding their activity. They were
beings that fully understood the ins and outs of commerce, the proper function
and application of material resources. It can be said that their minds were
merged with or had perfected the knowledge of how to maneuver resources.
The Sanskrit word "siddhi" often implies occult powers. Literally, it means
"perfection". Whenever there is a special ability regarding a particular activity,
or a perfection in its understanding and application, there is always a super-
cognitive acquaintance or an element of genius at work. This formula explain
ssiddhi: the perfection of a particular mental faculty or function. “Genius consists
in the proper use of things,” explained Swedenborg.

Normally, one doesn't associate occult mental powers with crude activities such
as commerce, as in the case of the yaksa. The notion of occult powers usually
applies to the psychic and psycho-spiritual planes and activities of mind.
However, the yaksa is one whose genius is focused on a mundane activity. If this
particular mind would have a subtler object of mental occupation, then they
would attain siddhi in that arena as well. It just so happens that the genius of
this particular mind is directed toward the crude material world.
All spheres of existence have laws. The levels of consciousness that relate with
these planes of being can apprehend these laws and correspond their activity to
this understanding. The yaksa is one who understands the essentiality or
dharma of commerce and has perfected or almost perfected their activities in
harmony with these laws. The yaksa is not the ambitious capitalist who hoards
for his or her self gain. Minds such as these have only a partial understanding of
commerce and only want to use their knowledge and experience to exploit the
physical world. The yaksa is moralistic and spiritual. He or she realizes that this
physical world is not the be-all and end-all of existence, that it is a passing show.
The physical world and the physical body are but vehicles for life to move toward
the psychic and spiritual worlds. Through the proper use of limited physical
resources and their proper distribution and application, human beings can meet
their physical necessities without excessive toil and effort and therefore have a
balanced physical existence so that more time and energy can be channelized
towards inward, psychological and spiritual growth.

The yaksa understands this essential dharma of the physical world: that it serves
the spiritual. However, a common fact with the yaksa or any other type of genius
is that their abilities require a bit of attachment. It is not the case that they were
blindly attached to an ambition. Subtle intelligence cannot manifest when there
is unconscious compulsion as the mind is egocentrically isolated from this
essential knowledge. However, there must be some form of personal attachment
propelling the mind in its activities. In this case the manipura propensity of
ambition or craving is culprit. Perhaps the mind was even free of ambitious,
egocentric and vain qualities and all that was left was merely the association of
the identity with a specific activity. The personality holds onto this identity
because it is simply familiar. And it is precisely this exclusive identification that
causes the yaksa to take the form of microvita after death instead of attaining
complete spiritual liberation, or moksa.

Human life is immense. We are microcosms in a macrocosm. We evolve, live,
die, and reincarnate into so many times, places, and personalities; each time
requiring new talents and abilities; learning new lessons and laws. Continuously,
we are learning how to refine and perfect our activities. It is when we come
closer to this perfection that we begin to express the divine. Whether one is a
singer expressing the perfect tone and feeling of a song, a thinker who elevates
his thoughts toward the sublime and orderly, or a simple artisan who performs
her work with joy and creativity, all of human activity can reach toward the
divine order. Human life is an ideological flow toward the Infinite. The purpose
of a microcosm is to evolve and familiarize itself with all forms of being until it
grasps the essence and magnanimity of the Macrocosmic Mind of Brahma.
However, through a process of spiritual expansion and growth, eventually the
mind will break free of all limitations and return to its union with the
macrocosmic consciousness, beyond all bounds of relative expression..
A state of being like the yaksa exists because the ideological flow pools into a
stationary identity. The mind gets locked into these faculties and the multi-
dimensional movement of evolution is temporarily hampered. The yaksa
personality, after death, must requit all of its personal attachments for their
mental specialty so that the evolution of mind can continue toward the
development of other qualities so as to make the mind spiritually whole, as is the
Macrocosmic Mind. In fact, Macrocosm is continually converting the microcosm
back into Macrocosm and must therefore arrange ways for microcosms to work
out their karmic pendings.

Behind every phenomenon is a spiritual force. The yaksa merges with the
Macrocosmic Mind after death and serves as a faculty within the Macrocosmic
Mind. Its mental energy and impetus (samskaras) merges with all of the laws
and wisdom that regulate the dynamics of the material world. The yaksa must
exhaust its exclusive identity by completely serving out its personal samskara. In
one manner, the yaksa achieves its desire of complete knowledge in its particular
field of specialty, but in another loses its entire lateral freedom as it becomes
completely absorbed it its desire. It is therefore a state of bondage in which it
must spend a determinate amount of time requiting its personal attachment. The
manner in which this is done is by giving its abilities to others who need to
develop them. For example, lets say there is a person with a noble and
charitable mind but who still is driven by a little greed. He lacks the
understanding of how to properly direct his ambitions. Because he has a degree
of goodness and subtlety of mind he is capable of understanding the proper use
of things. The disincarnate yaksa is the master of this mentality. Because its
mental energy or samskaras have merged with the intelligence that the
embodied being needs, the yaksa, via intuitionally percolating or downloading
ideas into the mind of the incarnated being, can actually transmit this
knowledge. This form of transmission occurs unconsciously. The incarnated
mind has a certain intention, in other words his thoughts are flowing in a certain
direction. The yaksa, whose essential mental vibration resonates with that of the
incarnated mind, can create a connection through their mutual attraction. The
incarnated being needs to develop something that he lacks, while the yaksa has
become overdeveloped and needs to discharge its abilities to others in need.
They are a perfect complement.

Now we can see a little clearer how there is a governing being or deva behind
the expression of one's vrttis. The mind being aided cannot fully develop his
potential because the expression of his ambition distorts the sensory and
intellectual mental layers. (Recall that the expression vrttis distort the mind
field and one cannot have full access to their respective corresponding mental
layers.) The yaksa is somebody almost perfected in its understanding of this
level of mind and with a greater degree of control over ambition as well. It is
therefore able to act as an appendaging causal force for the incarnated mind
who very much needs to learn what the yaksa has learned so thoroughly.
With this example we can also see how the quality of mind determines the quality
of microvita attracted to that mind. In the above example, the person is kind and
charitable, but is still driven by greed and ambition. Because of his positive
qualities he is able to attract a positive mentity in the form of yaksa to help him
purify his ambitions by putting this energy and its corresponding mental
faculties to good use. If the mind had not such positive qualities perhaps it
would attract an entity that only wants to sustain the status-quo or even
degenerate it into overindulgence. This would be a so-called "negative mentity".
All forms of microvita function in sympathetic harmony with incarnated minds.
They only vary according to the type of mental activity and the faculties used.
The next type of mentity microvita that Anandamurti described is termed the
kinnara. Kinnaras, like the yaksa are moral and spiritually elevated beings that
have attained a very special understanding of the macrocosmic creation. The
specialty of the kinnara is aesthetics of physical beauty. It is not aesthetics of art
or music, the fine arts pertain to another type of mentity. The kinnara mind is a
bit subtler than the yaksa. While still being preoccupied with the mundane,
physical world, it is enchanted by the idea of perfect form- the manifestation of
transcendental beauty in the physical world. The kinnara mind apprehends a
greater beauty and knows that all beauty is from god. The kinnara seeks the
eternal resplendence in the manifestation of finite forms. What is meaningful for
the kinnara mind is that which is beautiful. In beauty is represented all that is
truthful and virtuous. Beauty is the decor of truth and goodness in which is
revealed the higher intentions of creation. When something is beautiful, such as
a human figure, an object, or home it expresses more of the essence of eternity.
So by the desire to appreciate and behold beauty, the kinnara is performing its
worship of the Infinite Being.

This aesthetic appreciation isn't merely the vanity of the aesthete. The kinnara is
one who realizes that virtue is within beauty and has therefore morally purified
one's mind to some degree. The vain aesthete doesn't realize the essence and
archetypal function of beauty. Rather, he or she adorns the body and the
environment for egocentric delight. The difference between the aesthete and the
kinnara is that the kinnara realizes the essence or dharma of beauty: that beauty
attracts the mind and is a calling from the infinite to all creatures that we must
seek out subtlety. Beauty is this subtlety, this subtle order that exists beyond all
things. And it is through the attraction toward beauty that we learn to appreciate 
the subtle essence of things. Therefore, beauty is a representative of dharma. Beauty 
without this moral element of dharma is nothing but fascinationand lustful craving 
of the senses.The yaksa mind is one connected to the sensory mind. Its astute 
development of the rationality of the sensory-intellectual mind governs the sensory 
mind. Therefore the sensory mind is properly guided and equilibrated by reason.

Yaksas, then, are lords of these two worlds or realms of mind. The kinnara goes
a little higher. It resonates with the vibrations of form emanating from the
creative mind. It is this level of the collective mind that gives a comprehensive
understanding to physical form. The subtle luminosity of this atimanasa kosa
(supramental layer) enlightens and enlivens the multitudinous manifestations of
earthly forms. The kinnara realizes this: that beauty doesn't dwell just in the
physical manifestation, but is a radiation from a level beyond. The kinnara mind
is attracted by this calling.  At each level of being the Infinite is attracting us. 
At the sensory-intellectual mind the god is Reason and Logic. At the creative mind 
the god is Harmony and Beauty.

The limitation of the kinnara is that it perceives beauty not exclusively, but
particularly through form. It realizes that beautiful forms are an intimation and
calling of the Formless, but is attached to and loves the manifestation to such a
degree that it cannot fully comprehend the essence behind the beautiful form.
This one-sided attachment to physical beauty is the cause that such a worshiper
of form becomes a microvita. In the after-physical-death state they must requite
their attachments for physical beauty by helping and inspiring ideas of beauty in
other minds. Just as with the yaksa, we see that what is a bondage for one can
be a great inspiration for another. Imagine all of the minds with little concept of
the essence of beauty and how their lives could be bettered and embellished by a
little aesthetic refinement. The kinnaras help to develop ideas of beauty in the
minds of those who are struggling to develop these ideas. They put a stir and
dazzle of aesthetic life into the baseness and dullness of concrete materialism.
The Macrocosmic Mind uses these kinnaras to attract minds bound by the
staticity of material life in the sensory and sensory-intellectual minds so as to
broaden their ideas and aspirations for more subtle pursuits.

The next category of mentity is termed vidyadhara, "one whose concentration is
in knowledge." The vidyadharas are beings advanced in intellectual knowledge
and erudition. They were beings who,while living, cultivated their intellects to
very high degrees. They are a bit more subtle than the kinnaras in that there
minds penetrated into the Vijninamaya Kosa or intuitive mind. In other words,
they expressed the vrtti of expansion of mind at the anahata instead of ambition
at the manipura. The intuitive mind is where conceptualization becomes clear
and lucid. Thoughts evolve into purely intuitive concepts. Here one begins to
understand things as they exist in their essence within the Macrocosmic Mind of
Brahma.

The yaksa may of had some practical knowledge of the mundane sphere, but the
knowledge of the vidyadhara is much deeper in that their minds are moving
more toward the source of conceptualization. Vidyadharas were very deep and
creative thinkers. In fact, all of their mental energies went into the pursuit of
knowledge. Because their manipuara vortexs are purified, they have full access
to the creative layer of mind associated with the manipura as well as a great
degree of the intuition of the anahata.

The vidyadhara's god is the god of knowledge. They understand that the
Macrocosmic Mind is the repository and source of all knowledge. Their pursuit
of knowledge isn't quite yet the pursuit of the pure subjectivity of the Atman, but
rather with objective concepts. However , the Vidyadhara knows that all created
things are creations of the divine, and by understanding the creations, one
begins to understand the Creator. The vidyadhara may have been a great
scholar engrossed in studies and books, but its knowledge isn't a superficial
intellectual knowledge. The spirit of its pursuit of knowledge was for a deeper
and comprehensive truth. At the level of the intuitive mind, the Macrocosmic
Mind emanates profound intuitions that help lead the mind toward higher
understanding.

The limitation of the vidyadhara mind is that, while it seeks pure intuitive
knowledge, its methods may still be based in the intellect. True, the vidyadhara
is not the average scholar, but at the same time he is not a complete mystic. The
vidyahdhara is more like the Socratic philosopher with a love of wisdom, a pure
and noble philosopher whose intellect is entirely devoted toward Truth. The
mystic only seeks and experiences atmavidya, the pure knowledge of the self.
The knowledge of the vidyadhara is still seeking this purer knowledge.
Therefore, the pursuits and work of the vidyadhara are still mingled with an
intellectual scholasticism. Vidyadhara may seek inspiration from the study of
scripture and the writing of scholarly work. This entity may have been well-read,
a great scholar or professor, a lonely writer, or recondite thinker. What
characterizes all of the possible types of vidyadhara is their partial reliance on
intellect instead of full establishment in intuitional knowledge.
Also, it is a common fact that a bit of vanity so often accompanies great genius.
Knowledge gives power, prestige and respect. The ego of such an accomplished
and gifted mind likely feels a degree of pride and self-satisfaction with his/her
accomplishments. However, a vidyadhara is wise enough to have transcended a
coarse and vulgar vanity.

The requital of samskara and purification of the vidyadhara is to help the mind to
free itself from the bondage of pending scholarly desires or intellectual pride.
Instead of possessing their knowledge for themselves, they must serve as
vehicles to inspire great ideas in other minds struggling to conceive of higher
truths. The vidyadhara has a bit of excess in this field, while so many other
minds are struggling to realize higher truths that the vidyadhara may have taken
for granted behind the veil of great achievements. They therefore merge all of
their mental capacity with the thought archetypes of the unconscious mind- the
creative and intuitive layers of mind. From this state of existence their mental
energy imbibes latent unconscious thought patterns in the collective mind that
can be more easily accessed by minds struggling to think in a more refined and
evolved manner.For example: there are so many great ideas from so many periods 
of time in thehistory of humanity. People are often limited from the access to 
the purest and noblest thoughts that have been thought by human beings. This may
be due to alack of education or cultural limitations that don't encourage mental
development beyond the physical world. Out of so many educated people in this
modern world, who is inspired to read Plato, the Upanishads, Meister Eckhart,
Tagore, or Emerson? Human history is full of original thoughts that can
potentially elevate the awareness of all human beings, if only they could access
them. The vidyadhara merges all of its mental energy into the archetypal
sources of these thought in order to help percolate or download these thoughts
into minds striving for the light. The vidyadhara must devote all of its existence
to the upliftment and revival of human intellectual culture in order to
compensate for his/her personal attachment to knowledge.

Another type of microvita is the gandharva. The gandharva mind is a mind highly
developed in the aesthetic sciences. It differs from the kinnara in that the
kinnara is attached to physical beauty.

The aesthetics of the gandharva are more abstract and intuitive than the
mundane aesthetics of the kinnara. Just as the intellect of the vidyadhara
operates on a higher mental plane than the yaksa, so does the aesthetic, intuitive
faculty of the gandharva operate on a finer plane. While the vidyadhara thinks at
the level of the intuitive mind, the gandharva intuits and feels the realities and
beings in the intuitive mind. Any appreciation of beauty moves toward the
intuitive layers of mind and deeper aesthetic feeling. The kinnara mind is
awakened to this intuition of beauty and the spiritual reality behind physical
form. It remains at a distance, however, worshiping and admiring beauty. The
gandharva, however, dwells in the intuitive mind and therefore has a deeper and
more creative understanding of aesthetics. In fact, the gandharva is the divine
artist. Instead of merely admiring beauty the kinnara is a mind that apprehends
ideas at the intuitive level and can interpret them through the mediums of art,
literature, music, poetry, and other fine arts.

It is at the intuitive layer of mind that the mind makes actual tactual contact with
cosmic reality. At the levels of mind beneath the Intuitive Mind, what we think,
feel, or in anyway perceive is but a reflection of the original creation in the
Macrocosmic Mind. The intuitive layer of mind actually makes a form of
"tactual" contact with the thought pulsations emanating from the mind of
Brahma. This form of "tactual contact" gives a very fine sensitivity to the
intuitive mind. One intuitively feels and conceives reality directly without
interpreting it from a series of reflections and refractions from the external
world. Take the case of intellectual, scientific ideas, for example. They are
empirical observations that are first filtered through the physical senses. The
vibrations of sound, touch, light, taste, or smell that emanate from an object
must make contact with the sensory organ, be interpreted by it, then it sends a
message to the association areas in the brain, is further interpreted by these
association areas of touch, sound, form, etc. in the context of time and space,
then are later organized into coherent thought forms through a complex process
involving the cerebrum as well as the mind. Therefore, ordinary empirical
knowledge is a complex process, involving many factors of interpretation. The
original object, the "thing-in-itself" was never experienced, only its reflection or
refraction, and then a complex cognitive process based on these emanations
from the original object.

The creative level of mind is a bit deeper than this sensory intellectual mind. It
resonates with the causal form behind the physical manifestation of the object.
It begins to perceive the essence of things in creative ideas instead of matter.
The intellect only apprehends the gross material effect. The creative mind
intimates the formal, creative cause of the material object. Therefore it is much
closer to essence than the expressed material form of the intellect and senses.
However, this is still an emanation of the thing-in-itself. The Creative Mind is
still seeing the outer shell, the form of the essential thought essence of a thing.
It is only at the Intuitive Mind that actual "tactual" contact is made and we
understand the "thing-in-itself" independent of its outer, formal and material
emanations. The thoughts, feelings, and concepts here, instead of merely
reflecting an object or an idea, mystically penetrate the essence of being. One
sees into and through creative being, whether it is a being in nature, a profound
idea in the mind of Brahma, or the characteristics of the mental life of another--
their thoughts, feelings, and inner aspirations and desires.

At this level, which corresponds with the Anahata or heart vortex, one
experiences the essential oneness of the universe. One realizes that there is no
real separation between the subjective "knower" and the objective "known". And
because the mind is at-one-with being, it can deeply comprehend it.
The gandharva is a mind that has a deeply intuitional understanding of
aesthetics. It comprehends the harmony, balance, and beauty of the intuitional
layer of mind and can therefore express these vibrations through the medium of
music, poetry, speech or any fine-art medium.

The art expressed through a gandharva-type mind is indeed the true aesthetic
science. The creative inspiration comes from a level of consciousness that is
deeply and spiritually conscious. The Intuitive Mind is like the Kingdom of
Heaven. It is the level where the macrocosmic thoughts begin to move and flow.
The Intuitive Mind, or Vijninamaya Kosa, is connected with the so-called Aerial
Factor. the Aerial Factor is by no means physical air, but the thought pulsations
(touch) of energy that are flowing through the universe beyond physical form. It
is this energy, or Prana, that is the expressed movements and pulsations of the
thoughts of the Creator. The mind here is very light, flowing with the cosmic
flow of being and enraptured by the pulsative vibrations radiating out of the
Macrocosmic Mind. For this reason, if one listens to music or poetry from a mind
connected to the Intuitive Mind, there is a profound and moving inspiration. This
type of art speaks of spiritual worlds and realms beyond the physical. When one
listens to the music Bach or the poetry of Shakespeare one hears a divine
perfection in their respective expressions. Their minds were perfected and
expressed their latent genius in their art forms. Their thought, feeling, intuition,
and creative expression resonated with this deep level of mind, comprehended
its psychic and spiritual laws of aesthetics, and then translated them into their
respective mediums.

When a being such as a gandharva descends upon ones mind and begins to
manipulate one's vrttis, all sorts of positive vrttis like hope, love, expansion of
mind, conscience, and a deeper definition of self are kindled. All of these
tendencies activated through aesthetics propel and inspire the mind on the
subtle, resplendent, and beauteous path towards Truth as Beauty.
True aesthetics is not a commentary on truth, but the pure expression of it. Like
Yeats said, "Truth is Beauty, Beauty is Truth." This level of art, for the human
mind, isn't really creation, but discovery. The Artist is but a discoverer, a pioneer
of how the essential truths of being and existence are expressed in beauty.
Therefore, the true Artist is also a mystic. It is not to say that this type of artist
penetrates into the pure essence of the infinite consciousness of Brahma, but
comprehends the higher layers of the Mind of Brahma*

*Metaphysically speaking, Mind and Consciousness are not identical. Most
people think of consciousness as a mental process. What is spoken of here is the
essence of consciousness, and not the mental process. Mind is a creation
emanating from the pure and unconditioned Supreme Consciousness. The
layers of mind or Kosas exist within Mind, while Consciousness is the essential
Witness and Source of Mind.

Another type of mentity to discuss is the Shaktiliina. Shaktiliina is derived from
the word, Shakti. Shakti is the divine creative force responsible for the
expressed manifestation of Brahma in the relative world. Although Shakti refers
to the divine creative force behind the manifestation of creation, it is often
translated as nature. A Shaktiliina mentity is a being with a profound loving
attachment for the natural world. A Shaktiliina will vary in expression between
the sublimity of the nature mystic and the sublimated sensuality of a lover of
incarnated, sensory life. A Shaktiliina is not the crude brute that only knows the
life of physical nature, nor is he or she the raw sensualist who only lives for the
pleasures of the flesh. True, the inspiration and beauty of life is expressed
through the physical senses. However, there is a deeply psychic, aesthetic, and
even moral ideation behind the sensory enjoyment. Rather than reflecting on the
abstract ideas behind creation, as in the case of the vidyadhara, the Shaktiliina
desires to experience Spirit concretely, in the senses.

The Shaktiliina knows that god is in all things and that the enjoyment of the
senses is really the spirit enjoying its creation while itself is in creation. The
senses too are divine or, in other words, the senses,while being a created thing,
enjoy other created things within creation. As William Blake wrote, "the senses
are eternal delight." Another poet that comes to mind is Walt Whitman when he
writes "All men are my brothers. All women are my sisters and lovers." There is
evidently the recognition of the divinity of all things, but with a touch of
sublimated sensuality. Even Tagore, when he stated poetically that this world
was created so that god could enjoy it through the medium of his [Tagore's]senses,
 was expressing this idea of the expression of divine beauty through the senses.

The Shaktiliina is a mind at the Intuitive level or Anahata Vortex. Their
intuitional, aesthetic, and moral understanding of this level is expressed through
the kamamaya kosa or sensory mind. However, it is clearly evident, as such in
the case of Whitman and Blake, that this enjoyment of the senses is not merely
sensory pleasure. There is a deep reflection of the intuitive consciousness upon
the sensory objects of the world. One sees the handicraft of the Divine Maker
upon every line, shade, color, and contour of form within the sensory world. The
Shaktiliina mind has an immediate contact with god through form. For it, there
is no need to seek the divine in severe renunciation of the senses. God is
immediate and apparent in all things, and it is the genius of the Shaktiliina that
sees a rock not as a mere physical rock, nor a tree as a crude physical being, but
as living embodiments of the divine.

The limitation of the Shaktiliina, as is the limitation of all microvita in their
respective forms, is that their love for their particular way of being is also their
limitation. The Shaktiliina, instead of developing all of the faculties of perception
and conception, direct their mental energy toward a certain sensory-intuitive
mode. A little bit of the tendency of thirst or craving still permeate their subtle
vision and thus perceive but a portion of all of the macrocosmic vibrations
emanating from the Infinite Consciousness. All minds will eventually become
one with Brahma, and therefore one with all of its macrocosmic emanations.
Therefore, the Shaktiliina, like all microvita, must undergo their respective
purgation and purification to continue onward with their spiritual journey.
The last and greatest category of mentity is the siddha. The siddha type of mind
is a mind that is mystically developed. Instead of having a particular faculty
developed with its corresponding abilities as in the case of the other mentities,
the siddha's mind is a mind that has almost entirely transcended the faculties of
mind. The siddhas are the great yogis and mystics. The practice of yoga is to
unify the mind and all of its faculties with the Supreme Consciousness, or
Brahma. Therefore, for spiritual union with Brahma it is necessary that the mind
with all of its propensities and faculties is transmuted into pure consciousness.
Because the Supreme Consciousness is the source of all being, it is the most
subtlest of all entities. The essence of Brahma resides as the mere witness of the
play or drama of the generation, operation, and dissolution. A being united with
Brahma transcends birth and death, all limitations and all sufferings. In fact, this
mind becomes one with Brahma. It is only when the mind is purified through the
full process of spiritual evolution that all of the propensities and layers of mind
are under the guidance and control of Consciousness. The mind that is fully
developed is a mind that is not fettered by the finite propensities and is thus
absorbed in the bliss of infinite consciousness.

The siddha is almost at this stage of mind. A siddha has experienced very high
degrees of spiritual realization in which the mind has experienced an almost
permanent fusion with the Supreme Consciousness. A siddha sees beyond the
veil of time and relativity and ego, thus knowing the impermanence of all things.
Creation is something very subtle, light, and playful for this mind that is so
connected with the sublime heights of god-consciousness. However, this exalted
vantage point gives this [almost] liberated and purified mind domain over its
subtle mental faculties and therefore access to the siddhis or mental powers of
the mind.

The true siddha is not the wayward yogi street magician or fakir.
Their mental powers are of the subtlest nature and are capable of the deepest
intuitional knowledge and benevolence. A mind endowed with these abilities is a
mind endowed by the power of the Macrocosm itself.
A siddha is a mind that possesses either one or many of the 8 occult powers of
the Vishuddha Vortex discussed in book I.

An example of a siddha may be a highly developed yogi whose intuitional
understanding and compassion has become so developed that his mind has the
ability to see the minds of others. He therefore has the ability to see what and
why another being is suffering from and can thereby know how to guide them
out of bondage. Or perhaps his intuitional intellect is so developed that he can
see beyond the present, into the future, and in to the past as well. These are a
few examples of some of the higher siddhis that one can develop.
As is the case with the other mentities, the siddhas limitations are their
attachments to their mental abilities. The cosmic station of siddha does not
necessarily mean that the siddha is an ambitious mind seeking the highest form
of power in the occult. Rather, it is necessary for the mind to be quite pure of
auxiliary tendencies for such higher faculties to ripen. It is more the case that a
siddha has simply become comfortable and accustomed to their modus operandi,
just as the Shaktiliina, gandharva, vidyadhara, etc. Maya, or the veil of cosmic
illusion is extremely subtle. Only the Supreme Unmanifest Consciousness is
beyond its domain. Even the subtle and causal levels of the Macrocosmic Mind
of Brahma are under the domain of Shakti and her sentient, mutative, and static
forces that create Maya.

It is certainly easy to understand how a mind adorned with such noble powers
and abilities can become accustomed to their state of being, thinking that these
divine abilities are the summum bonnum of spiritual realization. What the
siddha doesn't fully realize is that even the Macrocosmic Mind with all of its
occult powers and subtlety is still in the plane of the relative and created. The
spiritual destiny of all microcosms is to return into union with the essential
consciousness of Brahma, beyond even the domain of the Mind of Brahma. The
siddha must therefore remain in the higher kosas of mind and help spiritual
aspirants to attain their liberation. The mental energy that wasn't fully utilized
by the siddha that was instead directed toward the subtle mental powers must be
directed toward guiding minds toward subtler notions of pure spirituality.
The siddhas are bound in varying manners to the minds that they are helping to
liberate. The lower siddhas may actually dwell inside a microcosm and thus be
interfused with it. Due to this fusion the siddha experiences the bondages of that
particular mind as its very own. It must therefore utilize its spiritual power to
liberate itself from the samskaras that it has taken upon itself. Perhaps this type
of siddha was a little aloof from the needs of other spiritual aspirants. His/her
mind was more directed toward its particular occult faculties instead of a purely
universalistic spiritual outlook. Not that it was vainly self absorbed, but that the
siddhis were a distraction to genuine spiritual service to others. The siddha
therefore descends back into the bondage of samskara with all of its mental
power. Only now it is weighed down by the samskaras of others. In this process
of liberation in which the siddha directs its spiritual force toward the genuine
liberation of other minds, the siddha is able to resolve its misdirection of spiritual
energy and learn the true spirit of universal compassion, of pure giving.
A higher siddha, being almost divine in its purity, merges into the divine activity
that guides microcosms in the most subtle of realms. They are verily the
archangels, the beings closest to the Supreme Deity. Brahma, being Infinite and
Eternal, is beyond the scope of activity. The siddhas are the active expression of
Brahma. The siddhas actually are the divine actions.

The mythologies and religions of all cultures resonate with the variegated
aspects of the Supreme Consciousness; some see a very limited perspective,
others comprehend a vaster array of divine qualities. There are deities of
Generation, Operation, and Destruction, the Brahmas, Vishnus, and
Maheshvaras. There is a Christ that manifests as pure faith and devotion. A
Buddha expresses universal compassion. Sankara is the expression of the
divine intellect that liberates with its pure reason and discernment.
A mind that meditates and contemplates on these elevated spiritual concepts
finds that these are living ideas with a spiritual momentum that actually consume
the ego by directing it toward the infinite. Here one sees how all of the mental
faculties are essentially "empty": they have no end in themselves, but instead
lead toward absolute transcendence altogether.

An elevated siddha merges with a divine activity or faculty and thus empowers it
with its cultivated spiritual energy. When a microcosm is participating in such a
corresponding faculty within his/her mind the siddha is there, so to say, waiting
to receive the mind and elevate it even higher. In other words, when a
microcosm discovers an occult faculty, it is already enlivened and empowered by
beings that are masters of their domain.

Siddhas represent the highest form of self-sacrifice. They are the purest of all of
the mentities and are therefore capable of helping all souls in the subtlest of
manners. A siddha is actually a living extension of an aspiring mind. The siddha
is what unites itself, the cosmic faculty, and the macrocosmic faculty as one
process. Therefore, the siddhas aid in the liberation of microcosms from all
forms of Macrocosmic bondages. Of course, Brahma is the Supreme Liberator,the 
entity that inspires all action. The sidddhas, rather, are the active extensions
of Brahma.

The siddhas are connected, or rather the controllers of the 16 vrttis of the
Vishuddha Vortex. Recall, that the vrttis of the Vishuddha Vortex guide the
limited ego's dualistic vrttis toward unqualified unity with Brahma. Therefore
when the mind is under the influence of the noble vishuddha vrttis such as
devotion or universal compassion, or is expressing the occult perceptions and
activities therein, the mind is unifying with a siddha controlling these
expressions.

The question may come about as to if the siddhas are to be the object of one's
worship or meditation. Siddhas are Macrocosmic functionaries; they are the
active agents of Brahma, but not the supreme controlling force. The spiritual
destination of a microcosm is even beyond the macrocosmic mind of Brahma
itself, in the unmanifest essential consciousness of the eternal, infinite, and
immutable Brahman. So how can it be possible that a siddha be one's object of
ideation? They are unified in macrocosmic processes of Saincara and
Pratisaincara, or Involution and Evolution, but not in essence. Process, or
Involution and Evolution, are always in relative activity, while essence is the goal
of process, beyond all limitations. The universe is so perfectly equilibrated that
all created things return to essence through process.

The siddhas are aids in this process of evolution. They are united with
microcosms not just to liberate them, but also to liberate themselves. In other
words, both aspiring microcosm and siddha seek the same desideratum, union
with Brahman. Recall the difference between liberation and emancipation, or
mukti and moksha, discussed in book I. Liberation is liberation from
microcosmic samskara where the microcosm unifies with the Macrocosm.
Emancipation is the union with the essential consciousness of Brahman, beyond
even the Macrocosm.

The siddhas are liberated beings. Their personal samskaras have unified with
the collective, macrocosmic samskaras. They still must work for their
emancipation, however.

Another question may thus arise. "Who is emancipated first, the microcosm, or
the siddha? Or are they emancipated together?" This depends entirely on the
given situation. In most cases the influence of the siddha and the vrttis that they
are helping to manifest in the microcosm are very deeply rooted in the
unconscious of the microcosm. The microcosm need not even be aware of their
presence. The siddha may guide this mind until the microcosm has sufficient
wisdom and understanding that the vrttis that the siddha was manifesting have
become sufficiently learned for the microcosm that they have become second-
nature. Then the siddha may be freed from the samskaras of the microcosm and
return to its own process toward emancipation.

However, once being freed from the samskaras of the microcosm, how are they
emancipated from their divine macrocosmic activities? Can a siddha be
emancipated from the bodiless state? These are indeed questions of the subtlest
nature.

According to the author's understanding, there are two ways in which a siddha
may be emancipated. The first is where the siddha must be reborn in a physical
body to finish its pending activities. This would of course be a reincarnation of a
very saintly soul or great teacher.

The second way is that is the siddha can connect with the mind of another great
soul that is embodied, then that embodied soul may emancipate the siddha by
consuming its pending activities and therefore transfer them onto itself. The
embodied being therefore becomes endowed with the sublime qualities of the
siddha. The mental force of this great soul has the ability to awaken its kundalini
and elevate it to the Sahasrara Vortex. In this process of the elevating of the
kundalini, the siddha who has attached itself to this mind, is carried upward and
emancipated by the fusing of the great soul with Brahman. Therefore, only an
embodied being capable of unifying with Brahman may liberate a siddha. He or
she has the capacity to be emancipated, but instead chooses to remain behind, in
creation, aiding all microcosms in their evolution. The great soul, returns from
his/her experience of samadhi and continues its noble work, only now with even
greater power as he/she has accumulated even more spiritual force.
Occurrences such as this happen when the Macrocosmic Mind needs to express
its work through an elevated, embodied microcosm for the spiritual upliftment of
a culture, country, or an entire planet.

Many mythologies around the globe speak of how the gods are envious of human
beings. Perhaps with the previous statements of how a siddha needs to return
and reincarnate into an embodied state or be liberated by a microcosm, we can
understand how this is true.

Creation is a complete act, from the subtle to the crude, and is not complete until
it is completely manifested in the physical. All of the kosas of mind and their
corresponding elements created in the involutionary phase of creation tend
toward manifestation in the physical, Solid Factor. Mahat generates Aham,
Aham generates Chitta, from Chitta the static force of Shakti continues to
condense Chitta until Ether is formed. Involved from Ether is the Aerial Factor.
Aerial Factor condenses into the Luminous. From Luminous is the Liquid, and
from Liquid, the Solid Factor.

Mentities work in the subtle realms, behind the physical world. However, the
nature of their work is to spiritualize all of creation, even what is manifested in
physical reality, the Solid Factor. Working in this manner, they follow the will of
the Macrocosmic Mind: that all things reveal Spirit through their manifestation.
The fundamental urge in the creative process of Brahma Chakra is for the Infinite
to manifest itself in the finite. Mentities help to teach us the spiritual essence of
all things in all forms of activity. If a human being is lost or estranged in the
vastness of creation, doesn't understand the grand purpose for his/her existence,
can't see the spiritual beauty and profound meaning already present in the given
environment, then the mentities attempt to show us the way out of our illusions.
Brahma will, using its mentities, liberate all beings from their created bondages.
Brahma is the Entity that has generated all beings, it is its will that sustains all,
and it is its eternal responsibility to liberate them as well. Mentities are the
divine forces that help to ensure that all beings follow their inherent nature, or
dharma. They eagerly wait, behind our thoughts, feelings, and actions, to show
us the way toward the righteousness and correctness that corresponds with our
existential place in creation. Mentities, according to their varying abilities and
powers, all have the responsibility to guide microcosms at least a few paces
closer in our continual orbit around our spiritual nucleus.

It is for this very reason that the siddhas must be liberated from a physical base.
In order to complete the cycle of creation, one must see the absolute oneness of
Brahma, that even this physical creation is a manifestation of Spirit. Without this
understanding we have not fulfilled our purpose in this creation. Has the
Macrocosm created all of this only to show its essential nothingness, without
purpose or reason? The illusionist, the spiritual nihilist, closes his eyes all
through the day only waiting for the sleep of night. It is the same with all that
resist Oneness. They seek an escape from how things really are and deny the
essential spirituality of creation and fail to see that this world is the name for the
nameless, the expression of the inexpressible and that there is a place for each of
us. As long as one resists the spiritual nature of creation there is no release from
it. As Vivekananda once stated, we must leave our mark on this world before we
go. True, all is intransient, vaporous, shadowy, and incessantly passing away
from us. But within this hazy mist is a definite theme and purpose for its every
particle.

<p><br /><br /><br /><br />To see the world as a frameless photo<br />and wander through the night,<br />or submit to sweet affections for earthly form<br />caressed in the light of the known.<br /><br />Can we endure Your darkness<br />and pass by the light from these wanderer’s inns<br />ensconsed from this dark forest?<br /><br />Into many such places have we wandered,<br />been visitors in tidy rooms with polished, sturdy floors,<br />taking refuge in comforts that won’t endure.<br /><br />Sun sets and a gentle wind ripples through a field of wheat.<br />Gold waves flow and the crickets tone to the silent Om<br />and a silent love that fills all space.<br />This heart reaches to touch the setting sun<br />and forgets the hand can’t always reach where I am.<br /><br />Deeper into night, infinite vision hastens me onward.<br />entreating me to await the new dawn.<br />Your darkness is more certain than form and self,<br />It is only You that I see clearly.<br /><br />Are you Father, Mother, Lover, or Friend,<br />dear, eternal I that lives and breathes me?<br /><br />Your quiet I sees all that is flowing<br />within the banks of our great being;<br />the light of billions of setting suns,<br />the evolution of innumerable lives,<br />the rise and fall of countless empires,<br />seeing the great reduced to nothing<br />and those reduced again made great.<br /><br />Few fathom your great secret,<br />tread against your outward flow, and capture<br />the lord of creation at rest beyond the play.<br />Eternally here, source reflects only source,<br />a quiet pool without ripple nor reflection,<br />we sink into sweet unknowing.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;“The harmful internal consequences of over-industrialization not only  affect the personal, social and national health of the people, they also  precipitate gradual individual and collective psychic degeneration. A  type of psychic epidemic may arise which can poison almost all  expressions of life and destroy them. This may not happen today, but it  will surely happen in the very near future.” - Anandamurti<br /><br />The  following statement sounds fantastic to the materialist. However,  Anandamurti always spoke about all subjects- economy, ecology, politics,  etc., from a very spiritual perspective. If the universe has a subtle,  spiritual counterpart that controls the material world, and if the  universe is moral, then perhaps this statement may seem plausible. Any  living, intelligent system has defense mechanisms that protect itself  from illness. If the universe is really conscious and a living entity in  itself, then one should see this statement as a great warning to  materialists with their ill-conceived concept of dominating, controlling  and eventually destroying a world they really have no true connection  with, a world that is in no way an Earth Mother for them. Can our mental  distortions and errors actually generate psychic epidemics?&nbsp; Can the  human race generate reactions that attack us not just from our physical  environment, but also from our internal mental environment as well?&nbsp; The  question is a practical one, finally, in that one has to investigate  these spiritual question in the mental laboratory. If you don’t figure  it out, then you may not survive the upcoming and inevitable natural  selection process.<br /><br />The future humanity will see the first decades  of the new millennium as the end of one age and the beginning of  another. Rather, it is the destruction of one age and the creation of  another. Everything we see as solid and real are but shadows of deep  ideas, the original Things as they exist in the mind of god. Most see  the universe as a play of material forces. Others understand the deeper  ideas that move beyond mundane existence, which is nothing but a mundane  manner of perceiving and conceiving the universe. Refining perception  and conception beyond crude materialism and blind desires gives us a  deeper perspective and more meaningful place on this moving and evolving  planet. What evolves is consciousness and the ideas that develop higher  awareness that can help us integrate into the life of the Macrocosm,  the living universe. A more compassionate and holistic mind is but the  evolution and refinement of the crude conceptual mind and its  corresponding mundane desires. In this view, the destruction of the  capitalist, materialistic mentality and the emergence of a new and  conscious Left are but the shadow play of great ideas that are competing  and clashing somewhere even beyond the invisible dark matter of the  universe. Evolution is always the favoring of some members of a species  over other, less adaptable members. The materialistic mentality of this  age will only destroy itself and the members of this part of the species  that are resistant to higher change and evolution will simply be  “selected” as to have no place on this planet in the near future. Step  aside radicals and revolutionaries, Mother Nature is much more radical  than a black panther, yet more loving and wise than a million brilliant  grandmothers.<br /><br />The destruction of the old systems has its origins  deep in the creative forces of nature, the intelligent forces that  preserve life and its proper purpose in the universe. Although the  planet may move and rock a little in the near future, these movements  are only crude reflections of what is silently moving upstream, in the  causal mind behind nature. Almost nobody goes against the current and  ventures up that far ahead nowadays. Materialism is not just bad culture  or unrefined brutality. It is a soul-killer and the greatest enemy to  humanity.<br /><br />The inner mind or soul comes in contact with this world  through its connection to our brain and nervous system. A part of this  entity that makes immediate contact with the physical world of matter  and energy is actually transformed into those very objects of mind.  Yogis call this part of mind <i>chitta</i>. Chitta is essentially a  medium between the inner world of mind and the outer world of matter. It  has the intelligence and essential substance of mind and at the same  time the formal structure of matter that intelligently plays out any  form that it comes in contact with in the external world. Chitta has  instinctual programs that are provoked and activated according to the  hosts of form that it entertains. If the mind only entertains crude  occupations, then more chitta is wasted by transforming itself to  reflect crude forms and play out their dramas- more money, more name and  fame, etc. Mind thereby moves toward and even converts itself into  matter. Materialists are actually rebellious as they move against  conscious evolution and the subtle moral order of the universe. Yogis  are more interested in allowing the Supreme Subjectivity, or Atman, to  see clearly all aspects of mind and its reflections of matter and form  in the world as the shadow play of the Atman, not as possessions to  contend for and thereby dominate and destroy others. Mind also moves  inward and evolves toward the pure spirit of the Atman. This is the  mind’s true purpose in evolution, to move inward, back into spirit.  Chitta concentrated and focused in meditation takes the form of the  formless, disintegrating itself back into subtler, inner forms of mind  until it eventually flows back into the silent headwaters of the  godhead, the Supreme Subjectivity. This is the salvation and liberation  of the mind. The materialist loses his/her mind and person into the  material world while the yogi liberates the mind by merging it back into  its source in the pure and conscious Witness. The mind can only be  “destroyed” in these two manners: disintegrating into matter or  disintegrating into spirit. One path is only agony while the other  delivers sweet bliss.<br /><br />The science of microvita is the intuitive  study of the dialogue between mind and matter, of the show unfolding  somewhere in the regions between the mental chitta and the brain. It is a  moral science to show us the way out of the labyrinths of the soul.  Positive microvita are forces that help convert chitta into spirit while  negative microvita impose crude forms and subsequently crude desires  onto the brain-body system. Positive microvita bring illumination,  fulfillment and realization while negative microvita eventually bring  about the degeneration of the mind. Human beings have always tended to  materialism as a consequence of lack of spiritual culture, however now  is the first time that the entire species is guided by forces that only  bring destruction. Globalization, the organization of  materialistically-oriented ideology and its imperialistic execution, is  the great destroyer of the planet. It is the imposition of a deluded and  abstract consciousness of a sick organism upon the innocent and pure  beings of this planet. If the planet and its natural state of balance  are in danger as a consequence of globalization, then one can only  imagine the state of our soul architecture within. And just as an  imbalanced planet will seek equilibrium anew, so will the collective  mental structure of humanity be forced to undergo extremely radical  transformations in order to survive this damage. The transformation of a  species is the most radical act of simultaneous creation and  destruction. Those whose intelligence flows inward to find balance and  responsibility with the Macrocosm will be favored by evolution as they  are much needed vehicles of human sanity. Their minds and nervous  systems will work in harmony with the new order. This new definition of  humanity will be imposed upon all. Grace showers even on the most  undeserving, although destroying them while forcing them to evolve. It  is as if we are all getting a software upgrade for our brains. The  materialists too are receiving this graceful upgrade but they have very  old hardware that simply cannot understand the new programs. They will  be obsoleted and recycled as they cease to function and lose their  applicability under new structures. Too much conversion of mind into  matter through ignorant volition and blind impulse degrades the nervous  system and creates mental illness. Negative microvita begin to burrow in  this energetic space between mind and body and help the misguided mind  destroy itself even quicker. These negative thought patterns  intelligently and parasitically feed off of our vital energy and make  compulsion, fear, and violence the dominant forces in our imagined,  separated existence. Negative microvita guide the destruction of  humanity by our selfish and brutal actions as well as attack and degrade  the nervous system from within. It is a race to see which aspect of the  activity of negative microvita destroys us quicker. Will it be through  war, fracking, economic imperialism and other forms of crude  destruction, or by subverting the internal mental order by creating  mental illnesses within as a result of falling into understand natures  traps for the dull, extinguishing parts of the species?<br /><br />The only  war we have is the war within. The chitta must flow upward and inward  and we must understand how to facilitate this natural process that  modern materialism has deadened, otherwise we are done for, both  individually and collectively. Take care of the mind, take care of  others and transform the inner nature and then there is no longer a need  for materialism, vanity, nationalism, racism, nor any other nasty  qualities of fearful, ignorant minds. If one does not fight in this war,  then these enemies will definitely destroy the soul if they haven’t  done so already. Instead of struggling for ways of life that lead toward  destruction it is much better to struggle for transformation and place  oneself under greater ideas, ideas that work and practically guide us  toward integration. It would indeed be a very boring universe in which  great worldly events did not’t play themselves out according to great  themes. Perhaps this is our malady; materialism deadens the living and  vibrant universe that caresses us and gives us place and purpose.  Instead of systematically killing animals for food, invading and  destroying other countries for resources, and over-consuming the  precious commodities of the planet, one can live simply and purely with  just a little spiritual understanding and social and ecological  responsibility. Materialism destroys the world of animals, plants and  most humans. It cannot contain these other worlds. Seeking the  collective welfare with compassion and consciousness conspires with the  intelligence of the Macrocosm to arrange itself so that its variegated  and vigorous elements synchronize into a sublime and simple order that  all good beings can understand. When the mind and positive and negative  microvita effecting the mind are balanced, then our limitations are more  natural and aren’t exploited by sinister and exploitative systems that  only degrade us and hinder conscious evolution. There is a place for  everybody in this essential world that embraces other worlds.<br /><br />Anandamurti,  in a talk called, “The Coming Ice-Age,” speaks of how the weather  patterns on the planet have been changing drastically since the 1980's.  He speaks of this phenomenon not as catastrophe but as natural change.  He links the changing polarity of planets poles as the underlying cause.  He says they will shift soon and with this change there will be changes  in electromagnetic fields. Many species will have to undergo biological  metamorphosis to survive these changes. Most human beings will become  extinct. Only those with refined nervous and glandular systems will be  part of the new humanity of the near future. I see this as natural  selection in action, although here we are speaking of a natural  selection based on consciousness and emotional intelligence instead of  brute strength or intellectual cunning and ruthlessness. With very  little personal, social, ecological, and spiritual consciousness it will  be difficult for the collective mind of humanity to adjust with these  changing electromagnetic fields. These human beings will become like the  Neanderthals of the past, an extinct species unless there are very  fast, radical changes. Anandamurti said that at times evolution makes a  sudden “galloping leap.”<br /><br />I view this phenomenon as a collective  kundalini awakening. The kundalini is the fundamental creative force in  the universe and not just a subtle force that functions in the physical  microcosmic organism. Anandamurti termed the kundalini the “fundamental  negativity.” It is “negative” in that it is the return force that can  recover even the most furthest centrifugal creative force with a radius  away from the cosmic nucleus. Kundalini brings the entire creation back  into the Supreme Consciousness. Kundalini, as it functions in the  microcosm, doesn’t take one further away from the cosmic nucleus with  extraneous worldly desires.&nbsp; Kundalini is the fundamental force that is  capable of returning all of our mental creation to its origin. No matter  how far our creation has materialized from spirit into matter, and no  matter how far we have lost ourselves in illusion, desire, or ignorance,  the Mother Shakti as kundalini will take us home.<br /><br />When kundalini  manifests in an evolved living being, she is said to be sleeping  dormant at the base of the spine in the muladhara chakra. This position  represents matter, the crudest manifestation of spirit and furthest away  from the point of Shiva in the crown. Because she is the fundamental  energy behind all expressed energies she has the capacity to control all  forms of energy. This is why it is said that due to the awakening of  this force through spiritual practice, all kinds of mysterious  phenomenon occur. One can concentrate for extended periods of time, have  tremendous mental and physical vigor, open latent psychic and occult  potentialities, and achieve elevated states of spiritual awareness.&nbsp;  Kundalini, as the “fundamental negativity,” is the force latent at the  base of the spine that brings every string of creation back into the  womb of Om, dissolving every flicker of color and cosmic sound in the  crown above the corpus collosum between the cerebral hemispheres and  above the pineal gland.<br /><br />Kundalini is Shakti, the energetic  counterpart to the pure Consciousness of Shiva. When Shakti's energy is  inactive, Shiva, or Consciousness, is like an infinite ocean without  undulations.&nbsp; Shakti activates she transforms Shiva by creating waves in  Shiva's infinite body of tranquil, equipoised Consciousness.&nbsp; When she  activates there is movement, creation, or involution. She creates the  entire universe.&nbsp; Later, She can dissolve creation back into Shiva.&nbsp;  When she comes back there is evolution of the universe through  conscious, living beings. When She returns to Shiva it is spiritual  liberation and enlightenment for the blessed soul who understands this  ecstatic union. &nbsp;<br /><br />Together, Shiva and Shakti, or Consciousness  and Energy, are the Supreme Consciousness.&nbsp; Shakti is the Cosmic  Creative Principle who manifests the infinite cosmic ocean of Shiva, or  Consciousness into all of the expressed waves of this creation. Shiva is  eternally pure and quiescent and can do nothing without his consort,  Shakti.&nbsp; Shakti wakens this latent Consciousness and takes it outward,  centrifugally, into action and creation.&nbsp; Shiva and Shakti interact  until the subtle wave of Shiva collapse into mind, then into energy, and  eventually into solid matter, or “star-stuff.” It is the infinite and  subtle Shiva that apparently becomes the universe by letting himself  manifest as created energy.<br /><br />With evolution of life and the  expression of consciousness in continually subtler and subtler forms as  Shiva and Shakti continue to manifest in biological life.&nbsp; Life, this  “blot of protoplasm with an urge,” eventually becomes conscious of  itself as Shiva re-manifests his Consciousness. Trees, mammals, plants,  and humans all have developed forms of consciousness which manifests in  miraculous forms of organizing, adapting, and growing despite the  material world’s entropy all around them! Eventually, these evolving  microcosmic minds will become so aware of themselves that they will be  able to ask themselves where this awareness comes from. This is the  arrival of awareness at the anahata and vishuddha chakras. The kundalini  is nothing more than the universal Shakti manifesting in an incarnated,  biological being.&nbsp; Kundalini is the purest essence of the divine Shakti  residing at the base of the spine; a force that ultimately governs the  entire nervous system. &nbsp;<br /><br />With the awakening of the kundalini the  developed vishuddha chakra begins to spin centripetally as the 16 petals  or sound pulsations vibrate the 4 vortexes of the muladhara, or base  chakra. It is like a whirling, astral tornado that creates a vortex from  crown to coccyx. This 4x4 action covers every possible expression,  every possible vortex of the muladhara from escaping outward into the  sensory mind at the first chakra. The causal mind with all of its  controlling strings of sound take charge of all of the inferior chakras  by descending all the way to the lowest base of muladhara. It is an  inner, highly organized and intelligent womb of sound and pulsation that  awakens the kundalini. All energy that goes into the emotional  expressions of the vrttis or vortexes gets sucked inward. This inward,  centripetal symphony pulls and summons the kundalini upward and inward  with all of the vital energy of the body. Here Shakti begins to act and  create deep inside one's soul. Shiva is the quiet eye of the storm  looking on from high above. Both Shiva and Shakti arrange the path of  bliss, the ananda marga, so that the aspirant may find one's way through  the various labyrinths of the ascending mind. This is the case with a  prepared mind, however.<br /><br />The structures of the individual and the  collective minds are one and the same, they are interdependent and and  co-existent. It is like a football fan in an arena filled with other  football fans. Gain or loss affect both the individual and the  collective body. Together, they form some form of meta-identity that  both the individual and the collectivity depend upon, or believe that  they do. In this similarity, we can see how the kundalini awakenings of  individuals will parallel the awakenings of the collective and  vice-versa. After 50 years of consciousness revolution in the West, and  most of it inspired by hallucinogenic drugs, it is easy to find a  plethora of examples of kundalini awakenings that have gone awry. This  is most often because the voyaging pioneer of mystical consciousness was  not psychologically prepared and/or awakened the kundalini through  forced yogic means or through the use of psychedelics. Aggressive yoga  techniques and psychedelics usually have the same results: states that  resemble a schizophrenic crack-up. Even with cases of eventually  successful awakenings, such as that of the Indian seer, Gopikrishna, are  often agonizing and take one to the border of self-annihilation while  on the path to Self-Realization. This blast of Shakti, or Shakti, is  simply too much for the average mind to bear. Could you just imagine  what would happen to the average materialist, Big-Mac devouring,  semi-conscious mind when it gets a dose of charged super consciousness?  The clay jug of the self is shattered to pieces. Mystics and geniuses  pick up the pieces and make colorful, beautiful, and playful collages  and celebrate the dissolution of separateness into wholeness. The  mundane person just finds his/her life is falling apart and cracks up.  We, as a species, have no choice in the matter: the rules of the game  are changing. We must evolve emotionally, intellectually, and  spiritually or disappear from the planet; there really is no other  alternative. All of the old mental structures that have projected and  created our social, economic, cultural, and science are quickly becoming  obsolete. In fact, they are already so rotten that they are taking us  down with them. It is the desire of the collective and individual human  mind to transcend obstacles that will decide whether one is part of the  new humanity or not. If so, evolution will shoulder you and guide you.  If not, and the mind wants to remain in the old and conventional, then  entropy and decay will recycle one back into the planet for better use.<br /><br />Kundalini  is the root energy behind all mental expressions. Mind is a derivative  of pure consciousness or Shiva that Shakti created long before the Big  Bang. Shakti, as kundalini on the return journey, can mend any  distortion and bring righteousness to our every wrong if we only  understand her Way. Shakti and Shiva are fundamentally one, and  kundalini only wants to return to her beloved Shiva. One must have a  developed anahata chakra, humility coupled with unswerving confidence  and much experience in meditation to adapt to this higher flow. The  lower propensities must be greatly purified, otherwise one will be  pouring gasoline onto the bonfire of the ambitious, clinging, and  fearful ego. It isn't the case that the kundalini of the masses will  awaken and surge into the brain and rapidly transform and rescue us all.  The changing planetary conditions of the present is really what is  making us a race of insane simians. Nature wants to awaken us while our  contemporary pseudo-culture only deadens us and holds up  psycho-spiritual evolution. Few seem to be finding balance. Most nervous  systems aren't prepared for what is already happening to us via the  subtle mechanisms of nature. Although the subtle, inner laws of Shakti  will be as gentle as possible, it will be difficult for the awakening of  the masses from the brute unconsciousness to just even begin to vibrate  at the second, svadhistana chakra. The collective kundalini force is  mainly focused on entering the second chakra and creating balance there.  Here, at the sensory-intellectual or conceptual mind, we develop  notions of self and world. There can be no balanced kundalini awakening  if one hasn't a balanced connection with the external world via the  svadhistana chakra. A strong svadhistana chakra isn't co-dependent nor  conventional but rests its value on its confidence and congruence with  the real world of Shiva-Shakti's universe. A spiritual aspirant seeks  not union with nationalism, with social class, or any other “ism” except  universalism. The whole universe is our homeland and it is contained  within Brahma, the union of Shiva and Shakti. Only those who can venture  to take this step will move onward. Now is the time of the great  purging. Balanced people, no matter how intellectually developed they  are, will move up an evolutionary “notch” from their respective  positions. It is much easier for a happy and emotionally healthy  goat-herder in the desert to move inward than it is for a neurotic,  apparently sophisticated, urban intellectual. The important thing is  that all people try to expand from their present state, no matter what  it is. Nature seeks balance and makes no prejudiced distinction between  high and low. All microcosms are dear to Brahma. This is what is most  important. However, the sad truth is that we as a species gradually grow  sicker and more and more unfit and unable to make this critical step.  True spiritual culture that cultivates deep awareness and moral  responsibility is unavailable or inaccessible to most. Due to this,  human intellectual and emotional life is becoming extremely imbalanced.  There is very little correspondence between who one is on the inside and  who one is on the outside. This contradiction will some day be  understood as the underlying cause of the extinction of the old  humanity. We must build a new and universal human culture on the ashes  of the present one. Nature's Heraclitian fire both consumes and  illumines, conserves and destroys. Only when the deepest desires of our  vast, inner nature find expression in universal human culture, where all  particular flowers are seen as part of the same beautiful garden, will  we have a society and culture that is truly humane. Our glory is yet to  be .<br /><br />The awakening of the kundalini should be prepared by a moral  base, through having attained some living practical wisdom of how to  live without creating unnecessary suffering for oneself and others. Only  those a little more advanced on this path are candidates for entering  this path. Although it is possible to awaken this force through  psychedelics, through intense, forced physical yoga practices like  asanas and pranayama, and other rituals, these practices are incomplete  by themselves and can be dangerous in in that they lack proper  psychological preparation for this bombardment of cosmic consciousness.  At most these practices may force the kundalini to the second chakra and  try to prematurely process the latent tendencies in the sub-conscious  mind. After such an exhilarating experience, one becomes overwhelmed by  the sub-conscious complexes of the mind. Insecurity, deeply-rooted  fears, compulsions, and paranoia are common side-effects of the  premature awakening of kundalini without proper ideational preparation  via deep and mature meditation, which of course requires a very high  degree of moral discernment. Although one almost never ever meets a yoga  teacher that has awakened the kundalini, this mysticism is the very  basis of the practice of yoga. Modern society only gets what it  deserves, Barbie Yoga.<br /><br />The greatest test is to bring the  kundalini through the Knot of Brahma at the navel, or manipura chakra.  It is here that one must contend with the 10-headed serpent who controls  shame, slander, jealousy, laziness, sadness, sadism, infatuation,  ambition, hatred, and fear. Due to deep progress in meditation and a  deeply mindful existence one has become ready to tackle the underlying  ambitions of the separate ego, that although subsided, still have plenty  of force to make a mess of your life. Once the kundalini rises here,  the underlying aggressions, ambitions, fears, and shame of the ego  become all too apparent. It is like trying to pay off a huge debt in a  very short time. Most would prefer to pay it slowly.<br /><br />I recently  dreamed of Anandamurti in which he was explaining to me that through the  current electromagnetic conditions of the planet, the collective  consciousness was being prepared to purify the sub-conscious and  creative minds (2nd and 3rd chakras). The evolutionary aim is to permit  more human beings to awaken the intuitive mind at the heart. The  majority of human beings live only in the sensory mind and the lower  parts of the intellectual mind. What is happening now is that the 3rd  chakra is being so powerfully purged that the collective mind will  either go insane or take refuge in higher ground. This cleansing of the  creative mind in humanity will allow a little more energy to enter into  the intuitive mind, or anahata chakra. We will still be, at least as a  collective mind, evolving and passing through the subtle laws that  govern the creative mind so that we can slowly gain access to the  intuitive mind.<br /><br />While the awakening of the kundalini to the  anahata chakra is not the ultimate aim of spiritual evolution, is is a  safe ground in which the “raging bundle of desire in a dying animal” has  quieted.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>The intuitive mind is related with the so called “aerial  factor”. This “air” is of course a most refined form of matter. If the  involution of consciousness into matter is a process of Macrocosmic  thought converting itself into matter, then the aerial factor is a  little closer to the thought end of the spectrum. It is here that the  mind moves beyond form. There is immediate insight or intuition into the  nature of things- oneself, others, nature, and the cosmos. One’s sense  of dignity at being a universal citizen of pure being overcomes all the  limitations of vanity and self-importance that the separate ego feeds  off of.<br /><br />With the awakening of the intuitive mind, one really  begins to see clearly how there is but one life in the universe, that  all microcosms pertain to the macrocosm. Thought waves that arise here  collapse into matter, into form. One sees how the secrets of spiritual  thought and pure feeling convert themselves into material creation.  Existence is but a crystallization of these subtle impressions that  manifest themselves from the Cosmic Mind of which you are now a part of.  Awakening the kundalini here brings a supernova explosion of energy to  the heart that explodes and projects your most noble intentions out into  the entire universe. It is vital that there are yogis and tantrics that  are pursuing this endeavor, thus clearing the path a little and  preparing the way for others.<br /><br />What is most important in  meditation is sincere effort. One rarely thinks that the victories in  your private arena have something to do with the evolution of a planet,  but they really, really do.<br /><br />Early in the kundalini awakening when  I was still a student in the university, I had many experiences that  shook my world apart.&nbsp; There was a period where I had many strange  visions that didn’t make sense to me until years later.&nbsp; During  meditation I would feel that I was merging into the whole city of Austin  around me.&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind would expand outward beyond the city and I would  get lost in bliss.&nbsp; It was terrifying yet exhilarating.&nbsp; It was the  death of the little "I."<br /><br />In one of these experiences I had a  waking dream in which I knew I was seeing myself 5 years in the future.&nbsp;  I was in Austin but on a farm outside the city where I was very happy  and at peace.&nbsp; I thought to myself that it was absurd because I had no  plans of remaining in Austin after graduation.&nbsp; I forgot all about this  dream until I found myself at this very same farm 5 years later.&nbsp; The  details of the vision like a telephone line crossing the property by a  creek proved exact.&nbsp; Meanwhile, back in '94, the vision continued.&nbsp; In  the next part of the vision I knew it was 10 years into the future now  and the scene changed.&nbsp; I was in Mexico in the middle of a war.&nbsp; I felt  very tense in this part of the vision but the scene changed into a third  scene where I was far above Austin, almost in outer space.&nbsp; I looked  down and the world was very different.&nbsp; The coast line was much more  inward.&nbsp; There were fewer people but there was much more respect between  them.&nbsp; I saw that they understood the lesson that nature gave them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  didn’t know when in the future this third part of the vision occurred,  just that it was sometime after the Mexico part.&nbsp; I wasn’t even sure if I  was alive on the planet, or floating without a body in some ethereal  space from where I was observing in the dream.&nbsp; It didn’t matter because  there was finally peace.<br /><br />I don’t necessarily believe in  prophecies, but when a vision has proven right 2 out of 3 times, then my  ears start to perk up a little about the third part.<br /><br />When  society loses its vertical vision of ethics, justice, universal love and  a humane purpose to existence, all of the members of that society  become ill.&nbsp; Materialism is the finite horizontal vision that teaches  that only matter matters.&nbsp; Materialism ultimately leads to the death of  the human spirit and the death of spirit leads to mental imbalance and  physical death.&nbsp; In the U.S. there are so many new fashionable medical  and mental diagnoseses and prescription drugs to mask these maladies of  the soul that effect all classes and colors of materialistic  consciousness.&nbsp; Existentially confused and aliented people who believe  in the established propaganda of modern medicine and psychology get  categorized into definitions of illness, weakness and loss of self  responsibility while often becoming chemically dependent on something to  attempt to keep them sane and healthy.&nbsp; Healing is a holistic,  spiritual process and is an impossible task to place upon a trained and  specialized materialist.&nbsp; That mentality is great for fixing mechanical  things but not for healing human beings.&nbsp; Trying to cure the human  spirit with erroneous and crude ideas is a vicious cycle of self and  social destruction. &nbsp;<br /><br />I am very pessimistic regarding the future  of our cuture of consumption and our enslaved materialistic  consciousness.&nbsp; The is no cure for this disease of materialism and there  should not be.&nbsp; The U.S. and Europe have advanced in material  "progress" but have already destroyed themselves from within yet  continue to divide and conquer and consume the rest of the planet. In  the end not even the greedy consumers are happy, not to mentioned those  who were consumed in the process of satisfying their demands.&nbsp; Just like  a stressed plant in the garden who sends out electromagnetic  frequencies that resonate with insects and attract plagues, our present  matter-centered society is a weakened entity that sends out similar  distress signals for parasitic invasion. The spirit is calling and its  demands must be heard but the more deaf, doped and existentially dazed  we are, the more we will send out this distress signal that invites yet  more illness.&nbsp; We do have a choice but if we don't align ourselves  Nature must finish us off and should not spare us as our conventional  consciousness has become a hindrance to the evolution of humanity.<br /><br />Volcanoes  and earthquakes may spontaneously arise with our destruction but the  spiritual cause of our demise are the accumulating psycho-social  diseases that have manifested.&nbsp; The law of compensation or karma is at  work in our world and is a terrible thing to witness, yet who can call  in unjust? We forget that nature also has a mind and spirit, that the  universe is ultimately a conscious and intelligent Macrocosmic entity  that knows how to protect itself.&nbsp; Whether referring to the individual  or society in general, mental and physical illness are but the  separation from spirit and forgetting that our little human, microcosmic  entity has a place and purpose in the Macrocosm, in the life of the  living, conscious universe. There is always hope for any human being  (microcosm) who still is in the struggle to maintain their essential  dignity, but there really is no hope for this materialistic and  narcissistic way of living that is making us all ill and destroys our  planet.&nbsp; These ideas are bred in the separation of the microcosm from  the Macrocosm and will also die in the separated microcosm.&nbsp; Ideas are  alive, both good ones and bad ones.&nbsp; They are angels and devils.&nbsp; Good  ideas unite humanity with justice inspire towards evolution.&nbsp; They  enter, live and grow within us and the Macrocosm acts in their favor.&nbsp;  Bad ideas do the same in that they enter, live and grow within us yet  lead us toward disintegration.&nbsp; The grandiose distortions of materialism  are fleeting microcosmic thought bubbles of our conventional awareness  that time has tricked us into believing permanent.&nbsp; Materialistic and  narcissistic ideas are an invasive mental parasite in the Macrocosm that  are already being attacked and neutralized by this host.&nbsp; Those who  resonate with degenerate ideas become infested with them as they are  designed to destroy.&nbsp; "The wheels of the gods grind slowly," so slowly  that we doubt there is really movement, but eventually nature's efforts  become apparent as what is no longer necessary eventually gets weeded  out. Sometimes the only solution to a seemingly impossible conflict is  radical transcendence; another vertebrae in a giraffe, a longer neck for  a turtle, or an opposable thumb on a monkey.&nbsp; For us on the eve of the  evolution of Homo Sapiens Conscientus, there is only hope in a radical  revolution&nbsp; evolution of self and social consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The strong and  the "most fit" are those that can resist by consciously processing and  understanding these maladies that invade and sicken us.&nbsp; Let us  re-organize ourselves with the living and let the dead bury the dead.<br /><br />I  feel certain that the solution to the electromagnetic imbalances that  are so greatly affecting the collective consciousness of the planet is  quite simple and clear: take refuge in a higher ground. This planet  maintains a balance with gravitational and electromagnetic forces by  which our consciousness, a complex process involving the glandular and  nervous system as well as the mind and Consciousness, has evolved and  adapted over millions of years. Despite the fact that many people are  having some severe problems of maladaptation to these new conditions,  there is a great potential to make some huge leaps in personal and  collective awareness.<br /><br />While contemplating the effect of the  increase of solar activity and its effect on the earth’s magnetic field I  find my mind always returning to the idea that all forces in this  manifested universe are but the result of three fundamental forces; the  positive, the negative, and the neutral; or the centrifugal, the  centripetal and the neutral. There appears to be an extreme bipolar  tendency in the collective mind. Almost everybody I know is in some sort  of emotional and/or existential crisis. If not crisis, then at least a  great challenge that requires tremendous effort to maintain equilibrium  and keep moving forward. Nobody I know has it easy these days. These  forces are external to our Consciousness, our Atman, but appear to  affect us because our minds are incarnated in physical bodies with  sensitive organs that are affected by electromagnetic fields. Due to  this adjustment there are many subtle imbalances in the nervous and  glandular systems that are altering how the mind thinks, feels and  perceives reality. However, meditation and spiritual practice have the  reverse affect. The Atman as the nucleus of consciousness vibrates the  contemplative, meditative mind with eternal peace and clarity and the  mind thereby vibrates the nervous system with this much needed balm of  soothing alleviation that puts our physical being back into balance.<br /><br />While  the centripetal and centrifugal forces are fighting out their eternal  game of clash and cohesion, the neutral force has the capacity to  balance them out, take them into the nucleus of awareness and find a  higher synthesis. But where is one to find this neutralizing force, this  mediator of the centripetal and centrifugal forces that dominate the  physical universe? The neutral force, the equalizing force is to be  found not in extroversion or introversion, nor action or inaction,  attraction nor repulsion, but in deep attention and presence of these  plays of the mind. It is the One presence behind each and every  microcosmic mind that maintains the balance of the entire Macrocosm. The  entire universe has been, is being, and will always be directed by the  One who directs all duality. If you want to bring the mind and emotions  into balance it is only through awareness of this blissful entity that  this play of forces may take refuge in the eternal repose of the Atman.  As Anandamurti said, “the force that guides the stars guides you too.”  Perhaps we are in a leap, a shift in evolution which is always and  extreme and violent act, but I cannot deny that it is all so beautiful,  and behind the apparent chaos and imbalance lies a greater, hidden  agenda that only the mind devoted to its source and origin can  understand.<br /><br />This energetic situation will only become more  intense until we as a species, a collective consciousness, begin to  understand this truth and cultivate a planetary culture which fosters  this awareness. So many are falling into emotional imbalances and  addictions. We go up too high and then we fall too low. We try to fix  the lows with a high and are incessantly chasing our tails in a circle.  Really, there is only One solution, and I hope that you all may truly be  here to presence it and be part of a new, awakening humanity. Take  shelter only in the loving, constant witness of the Atman, or the  combativeness forces of nature shall rip thy mind apart like a gang of  angry pit-bulls.<br /><br /></p><p style="break-before: page; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always;">an extract from&nbsp; <a href="https://workdrive.zoho.com/file/plethb9b7de25282f43d381eeb9815389b392"><span face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><b>Microvita And Tantra Maya<br /></b></span></a></p><p style="break-before: page; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always;"><span face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></p><p style="break-before: page; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always;"><span face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><b><br /></b></span></p><p><br /></p><p style="break-before: page; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always;"><span face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><b> </b></span></p><p><br />.</p>

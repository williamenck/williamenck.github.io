When I was fending off our ranch from the narcos I always meditated in this room.  I wrote about in <a href="https://williamenck.github.io/ahora-tantra">"Aghora Tantra"</a> of how I heard them outside of our property with a chainsaw one night.  I was meditating and I began to hear the OM sound so intensely that I could not hear the chainsaw.  I forgot all about it and went into a trance.  I came out of bliss in the middle of the night and remembered the chainsaw and thanked the "cabron divino" for the great experience.  

I also used this space for the Ananda Marga revolution.  I wrote a letter denouncing the CobraKiller Shamitananda to the members of Ananda Marga in North America.  I knew I did the right thing.  I went and meditated, saw an infinite white light and 8 hours later I took a deep breath and came out of the trance.   I did not know 8 hours had passed until I checked the time.  I knew I had been in the breathless state of samadhi all of that time.

After those experiences and my writings about the narco war more people wanted to come into contact with me.  I was hermit who hardly left the desert.  I was working with associates who had more connection with the outside world.  However, one of them saw herself as my manager and was jealous of anybody who became close to me, people who became my students and friends.  Eventually she started telling me that a group of students who are doctors helping the rural communities of Chiapas were really a band of sexual perverts and basically behaved like a group of Roman senators in togas.  This was her effort to get me to despise them.  I found it hard to believe.  Later, she started to accuse me of perversions and saying I was trying to manipulate people sexually.  Yet at the same time she went around praising me and telling people I was doing the work of the guru.
  
Also, the situation with Ananda Marga started going down quickly.  All we encountered were criminal and sexual scandals.  She became enraged over this and often her rage carried over to me, and perhaps even all men.  I became all the more the playboy in her mind each time she heard of these monastic scandals.  Later, when we began to encounter homosexual scandals with the monks, she really lost control. She never expressed hatred toward gays before this but later started to see homosexuals around every corner, and eyed them with hatred.  Later, she even said I was a homosexual.

This was all too much to bear.  She got the weaker members of our community together to take her side against me.  Nobody believed what she said about me but still some of them stood beside her.  Once, when I briefly left the place they burned my belongings.  I returned and did not know what had happened.  Later, I discovered.  I left and went with my students whom she had defamed.

Recently, their cult got together to have a "reinitiation" ceremony into Ananda Marga.  She told everybody Vishal was no longer a fit teacher and they all took initiation into Ananda Marga.  It was all because of their spite for Vishal and they were like a bunch of vampires dancing on his grave, in the house he had built and the spiritual vibration he had cultivated in that environment.  
Instead of taking offense (Vishal was never truly me) I try and see that it was really only the weak ones who took her side.  These people had deep personal problems and  came from histories of abuse.  I always thought Tantra Yoga was only for people who were already or almost "well adjusted" in life.  It was too strong of a practice for people with serious, fundamental complexes in their personalities.   Instead of being more rational, balanced and self-reliant, they really needed somebody to give them comfort and security and they took refuge in her just like the Ananda Marga members of North America took refuge in Shamitananda, the Cobra Killer.  I always wanted to avoid bringing people desperate to follow somebody or something into the circle because of my previous experiences in Ananda Marga.  I knew this could be what makes the difference between a cult and a spiritual society.  Yes, maybe the dark mother gave them her love, but she had to tell great lies about me and my friends in order to unite them.  

I can sympathize with her anger toward "machismo" within and without of A.M.  I did not like it either.  It provoked a lot of repulsion in me too.  Repulsion is a subtle tendency (at the Vishuddha level).  Essentially, it is a protection of one´s discernment (Viveka) and keeps harmful expressions away.  There may be moral grounds to feel repulsion toward immoral activities, yet one has to be careful not to fall into hatred.  Then, one´s heightened sense of morality can indeed become an expression of immorality if one begins to judge and slander other people.  Once hatred has taken hold of the mind then enters fear and paranoia.

There can be no unity based on lies and eventually these troubled people will realize they have all lied and have been lied to. What they have is based upon pure fiction.  I tried for sometime to cover for them with the hope that they would not fall too hard when they receive the reactions to their actions but it was a form of falsehood on my part.  Covering for people who hated and betrayed me, it made me feel so sick!  It is far better just to surrender them to the macrocosm and let the laws of the universe sort things out.

Over 10 years ago the president of Ananda Marga Mexico was stabbed over 60 times in front of his home.  The ex-president was a millionare with a vast inheritance.  After his death both factions (the Hindis and the Bengalis) of Ananda Marga were fighting over his inheritance.  Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into the death of Gagan, the ex-president of A.M. Mexico, revealed that the fighting over his inheritance began just before his death.  There was a question of Gagan changing his will to leave his inheritance to his family instead of Ananda Marga.  Both sides began to accuse the other side of complicity in his murder.  Cirananda, the "Headkicker" monk who had a reputation for violence was who one side blamed.  Cirananda, of course, blamed the people on the other side.  When I was at El Misterio we all just sat back and said "how crazy, who wants to be a part of this."  Later we heard stories from sources outside of A.M. of how Cirananda was a menace in the neighborhood where he lived and was seen as a danger to women.  The general view at El Misterio was that Cirananda was a madman and a pervert.  It was also known that Gagan was a pedofile.  People on both sides of A.M. knew of this and his position as president was often debated.  Some people in the Ananda Marga VSS (Very Stupid Soldiers) said he should be taken out. Other people covered for him.  There were not many members in AM Mexico and Gagan was the only person with money.  If monks or nuns working in Mexico needed donations from Ananda Marga, then they had to be in well with Gagan.  He payed enough people off to remain president until his murder.

Now I see photos of people of El Misterio with Cirananda, even dining together.  And not just El Misterio but the very same people whom Cirananda accused of murder are all dining at the same table!  The man who was accused of murder by Cirananda had said he had seen the mad monk roaming about with women in the local neighborhood.  He said that people had seen Cirananda making threatening sexual gestures  at women passing on the street.  Most people at El Misterio at the time thought it was likely.  I was not sure but he had tremendous violence and was very dogmatic like a Taliban.  Who knows what would happen if such violence shifted into his libido?  It was distrubing to think about.

But it is better to focus on the light side of things.  What resilience in our noble society of A.M. Mexico.  Now they can all sit together in the property and homes of the murdered pedofile leader and resolve their differences.  Now pedofiles, people accused of murder and public masturbation can all come and sit together at the same table.  With such a noble spirit of dharma you all can transcend all of the problems in A.M., maybe even unite the Hindis and the Bengalis!  I hope to see pictures of you all with the CobraKiller and the Bengali mafia soon.  Baba Nam Kevalam.

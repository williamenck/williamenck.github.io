We had nothing else to do under house arrest but meditate a lot and we were all really very high.  My friends and I made jokes most of that night about how we were going to survive the night.  They said the Texan (myself)should turn our hostel into the Alamo and make one last brave stand like Davy Crocket and the boys, using the guns we were accused of smuggling into the country.  I said that because we were already accused of being terrorists then we should just put panty hose over our heads and just be so freaky that the locals would be scarred of us and run away thinking we were demons.  We knew nothing would happen to us and nothing did.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//pantyhose.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1536" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-xs.jpg 640w, https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-sm.jpg 768w, https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-md.jpg 1024w, https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-lg.jpg 1366w, https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-xl.jpg 1600w, https://williamenck.art/media/posts/52//responsive/pantyhose-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p><br>Actually, there was a documentary about those events but I could never see it on servers in the U.S. or even in Mexico.  This was just a few years ago. 25 years after The Arms Drop occurred.  One had to use a VPN to see the free documentary online.  Like me, the documentary questioned why the US government was so interested in that affair.  At the same time some Indian journalists, authors, and film-makers interviewed me because they had read The Debate.  I was hoping that their work would not be overly serious nor factual and intellectual, that the movie would have at least some dancing at the end.  All of the main characters in many Indian movies, friend and foe, dance together at the end.  Just imagine those orange-clad clowns dancing with AK47´s while the CIA and MI5 agents boogie alongside them!  I would be brake-dancing.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 23, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://williamenck.art/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://williamenck.art/authors/william-enckhausen/" rel="author">William Enckhausen</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://williamenck.art/the-net/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Net</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://williamenck.art/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://williamenck.art/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

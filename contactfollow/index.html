I wrote about situations not so much from the gaze of deep meditation or abstract contemplation but from really mundane encounters in which the infinite light reveals itself in some really graceful and unexpected channels. One of my favorite metaphors for explaining the iterfusion <a class="html-a xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x1hl2dhg x16tdsg8 x1vvkbs" tabindex="-1"></a>of our human lives with the life of the living universe, or macrocosm, is the Hindu and Buddhist metaphor of the Net of Indra.</div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><div dir="auto">A scholar cited on the Wikipedia: "Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring."</div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><div dir="auto">Beyond all of the bad intentions with all of the ads, political manipulations, and spying FB still has been a manner of conecting with other jewels in the net. Of course it is not the real thing, but if one connects with others from the deepest and noblest part of one´s being then even FB could serve as a medium of interconnection. Of course I would prefer other less manipulated software or spyware to mimic this interconnection, but this is where so many jewels in this planet are reflected. Playing with this metaphor of FB as the true Net,it is actually easier to understood its opposite: a place where all the reflections that penetrate one´s being actually make you less connected and more egocentric. In Zuckerberg´s Net one looks for and projects the most limited and fragmented reflections as each fine jewel is gradually dulled and pulverized into dust.</div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><div dir="auto">Yet beyond the digital mechanisms of interconnection there is the image or a few words from of an old friend sent out to other friends or perhaps directly to you. It makes me remember them in their essence. I see them in the present and I knew them from the past. There is still a connection. I see they are still shining brightly, flowing from the past into their future, growing and expanding, as microcosms unifying with the macrocosm.</div></div><div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><div dir="auto">Yet this digital imitation of the Net often becomes becomes a little too stimulating, like too much coffee too late in the day. I find it difficult to sleep at night when I go into FB. It is the same if I go into an airport or a supermarket. All of those reflections that I encounter stay with me all through the night. It is usually not a negative experience. On the contrary it is quite positive in that there were positive interactions. Yet these jewels continue to shine through the night and Indra´s Net becomes more like a giant disco ball as everybody from the day is having a giant party in my room. Is this all too psychic or or just plain psychotic? And if I post a photo of myself then it is all the more intense, like drinking 3 cups of coffee and 5 in the afternoon. </div><div dir="auto"> </div></div><div class="x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a"><div dir="auto">In the past I would delete a FB account when there were hacking attempts or when I got malware injected into my computer while logging in. That rarely happens nowadays and so I now have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/william.enck.III/">Facebook account</a> that I share with readers of the blog.</div><div dir="auto"> </div><div dir="auto">The only tried and true communication software for me besides my email has been Telegram. I have the same account as I have always had and it has never been hacked. My Telegram username is @williamenck.  There are no ads nor tracking and it is open source software that can be publicly verified so as to not have any manipulations coded into the program. I do not have my own group nor do I use it a lot but it has always been an uninterrupted channel to maintain contact with others.  </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 25, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://williamenck.art/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://williamenck.art/authors/william-enckhausen/" rel="author">William Enckhausen</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://williamenck.art/william-enckhausen/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> William Enckhausen</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://williamenck.art/the-infinite-eye/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Infinite Eye</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://williamenck.art/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://williamenck.art/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

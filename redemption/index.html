 The mind alienated from Consciousness is so shrewd and powerful and manipulates in so many ways.  What else but chaos could possibly manifest when it is driven by blind, unconscious impulses?  Might it have been different is the desire was more conscious and if one checks to see if the Tao, or intelligent force behind the universe, is backing up such a desire.<br><br>The supreme consciousness is within us.  It is evolving through us.  Our lives are so much greater than we can possibly conceive.  Each life is the result of billions of years of evolution through so many forms of life- plant, reptile, animal- their DNA is within us and our DNA is simply stacked on top of theirs.  Where did this impulse come from and where is it going?  Humans gave a clearly reflected consciousness.  We can ask ourselves where our consciousness comes from, from where the notion of "I exist" has its origins.  Mystics of all times and places have realised the perennial philosophy of the union of the individual soul with the supreme soul.  There is no escape from human existence and the relative world.  Blind impulse only binds one toward suffering while attempting to escape the world also creates suffering and emptiness.  To find union with the infinite one must move with life and evolution and flow toward the One.  <br><br>I am on the side of optimism regarding the relative world.  Being here in time and space and on this planet at this point in time is important and it has a great purpose that is capable of being understood.  One can discover the laws of existence in the universe and walk in harmony with them.  Certainly there are desires that are a complete waste of time and only lead to degeneration (perhaps the majority of them in this materialistic time).  However, one´s truest desires are one what needs to evolve and eventually reach the spirit.  If spirit is behind life and evolution then spirit will take care of and fulfil such desires.  If one seeks a love that is to truly unify with others and make oneself more whole, then such a desire will be fulfilled by spirit because they are eventually for the realisation of the spirit.  The infinite unity of spirit can be expressed in the relative world by love and compassion towards all beings.  If one seeks a lower form of impulsive, selfish love and is frustrated and despairs, then that is actually a good thing.
